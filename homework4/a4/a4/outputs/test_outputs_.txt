You know what I'm doing is writing for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, I know in the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather <unk> and never no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell somewhere somewhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird <unk>
When she was beaten up to bleed every week in the <unk> until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom <unk>
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that teacher -- the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to get stuck with this.
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we had moved away from his family, because necessary, as necessary, as necessary, as necessary, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew what to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a <unk> box.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you was made in mind with himself itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this today.
You also need to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I would <unk> them around the water about 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think it was a <unk> on another <unk> over a year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold up to the end of the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> who are isolated and themselves, as we see us sometimes as human beings.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As an <unk> <unk> it releases <unk> fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was going to be the portraits of my ancestors, and so knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and will never exist at that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last photos I would like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's often often to come to see an <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one <unk> OK.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of it, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and of the sperm comes together to the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
They both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to us later.
In my environment, I will play two roles.
In one of my roles, I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- the anatomy of human bodies and <unk> how you have looked like the body fluids -- the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins, two people inside of a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many forms.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in the ordinary common forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene of the chromosome and tell the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then in life <unk> the testicles make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, it's high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops on the course of a course typically <unk>
When you <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a young girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not but until puberty, when it's growing and developing <unk> but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really not.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman doesn't know its <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman, most of the women as me are sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain of <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing, not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life like a guy and just discovering that he had <unk> and womb.
It was an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th <unk> and in the uterus <unk> <unk> were so active that, in essence, created a male autonomous environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component -- typically a male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with similar chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> which is, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know why it happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies were <unk> <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not so much to be able to support a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> <unk> <unk> being black means having a African anatomy in terms of <unk>
<unk> idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born inside one body.
The greatest recent case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put on the <unk> sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you test to figure out whether to <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there's not such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a line of <unk> between men and women or <unk> and women and <unk> we are the ones who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science goes forward, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were kind of fixed events that were <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
But also in terms of race, something that happens to be much more complicated than the <unk> terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What <unk> in the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we focus on science and more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> probably are too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body gets human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is <unk>
Our ancestors had never been <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of her to put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved it and moved still not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of really really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, making people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
I think that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking of <unk>
It was <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, which I find every kind of watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
This is what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember what our <unk> <unk> our <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of a birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the right of blood passed from the <unk> to the father and then the son, etc.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and they decided that anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the differences, and that was a very radical thing.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to <unk> that goes from a vague <unk> of birth to birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And the consequence were being broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened now happened to be known.
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people who are <unk> <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep them certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't mean that we should confront anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old should have been allowed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some sweet <unk> that I think make sense that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do you keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, <unk> was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: was born the one before 1980.
For the only fact that having been born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to <unk> the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry needs to wait for all that not because he has a different age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, the virtue of being considered man, if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered man now is <unk> of the legal <unk>
<unk> on his hand, doesn't have the same rights rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So I still have dramatic categories that are still <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went through both in the field of anatomy that we get to have to admit that a <unk> democracy can be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided to get married with a man -- you don't have to have <unk> and to marry a woman, you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests with the people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of the Yentl syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but on the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do people judge the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to <unk> rights to people, because I admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> I know can make more intelligent <unk> decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships than I know.
So how do you put the issue of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future being measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to move this current thinking in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian man who feels like a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed at least who is willing to have a change for sexual change, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made birth twins <unk> to then pick them up, and so she was <unk>
But when the phone asked the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, I said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, it's considered the political <unk> instead of <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who are not <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish the end -- I mean I've been talking about <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a <unk> and it's that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies we know is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and worry about those who are <unk> inside of the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in in feminism -- I thought I was interested in <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what has <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is about unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing <unk> in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, more than there is something <unk> in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> of complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect the people over the state, we may have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we make democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think of what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we needed to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where every family thinks where to go to live and work -- have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents in the world.
Well, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than its building cost.
So easily we could <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just <unk> by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment they were both owners, and that the other half is not going to use to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to increase in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around the surrounding have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building plans.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place, build a whole building building -- always and when the rules of that place will <unk> construction instead of putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments -- new reform zones to hold cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, we <unk> it went through a Chinese constitutional crisis.
In the following elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> imposed on a platform in which <unk> reforms and the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of testing with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, such as those rules that they say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It would be a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as rules for <unk> and they're usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Guatemala friend sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than its <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> terrain that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> land -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to make this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make it a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were really serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for her talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city to which you might be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help of <unk> countries that could benefit from countries associated and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily <unk>
And shortly afterwards, on the 19th of January, voted in the Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed us to create these special special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this desert crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
The February of February passed over again on a <unk> <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 of February, we have about 30 <unk> to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in North Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other interested country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and once it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last sentence for this new justice system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know has already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many businesses who wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change another place.
There are a million per year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job -- sometimes they are <unk> mothers who have to make money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
My friends were asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, <unk> and more recently, I photograph and post in my blog suits, <unk> colorful and different <unk>
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be about my size?
I'm going to like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what bring someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what suit.
I brought seven <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you about some of the lessons of life that I think or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've been used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be in <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a <unk> too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play <unk> or I remember his <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and the outside, you don't look at it you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth, six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal kind of personal personal and one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, and I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> for one of these extreme things, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be rational and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just as most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need quite a sense of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As intuition that you may have developed with the <unk> is the one that says one thing can be just in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in a parking bar taught a worthy lesson, which is that the big things can't allow them to <unk> and that remain in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with the car bars play with these little strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
And at that point was the physics few years ago; you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But it doesn't need you to describe the great objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk> mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't have.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to show you a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a very good approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little piece of metal with a springboard and a springboard and a springboard for a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming <unk> that is below the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum view, but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up, I leave you from doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that is <unk> and the wind going on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We <unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and we pulled them out all the air, and then we <unk> it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was <unk> and the way that <unk> was like a breath of this shape -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, <unk> we could make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are still still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
At the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every single atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on the scale between one single atom -- and that little bit of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my part of the logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, how would that be?
How do your consciousness do if your body was <unk> in space?
There is another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> and we lit the lights and look within the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it was 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There are lots of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that I can show you the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside that want to go at the end of the hall,
Let's go forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I came up and found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into deep and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you can actually see what there are.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So we're going to start to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> night.
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van <unk> actually created this <unk> play.
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can online to create their own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walk -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just got <unk>
It's about <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at the contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually came from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media do justice to your artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question you do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about this is a <unk> flying pixel up.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian <unk> all kids in Italy, grow with this picture of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting on <unk> careers in the last two decades.
So a few time ago, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, you would take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, it will be <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with electronic networks.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for <unk> at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old dream of <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end took the hammer and went to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> non <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something around.
Let's start with the <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago, in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World <unk>
Maybe some of you remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the Net.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the afternoon, early people there are people standing here and doing call <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night, everyone went to <unk> at the center.
You see the big peak.
The next day, everyone went into the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, it's about things that we use and consume them.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the garbage in their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little over a year ago to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They are going on complicated things, and there's a lot of economic transportation.
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not yet somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still still there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, come to that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and you have <unk> valves <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was created as a <unk> <unk> with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
I liked it.
And we <unk> a commission to design the entrance to the entrance ticket.
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors or no windows, but when you come up with it open to you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all of the architecture disappears like this case.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all the architecture away.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> by what's inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not try to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to open to you -- but a building that was still making <unk> and holes and you had to jump down to not getting wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things so that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and from projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw earlier, that moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this <unk>
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration.
Or a normal thing, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light comes on, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the best dancers of <unk> of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use it as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine you could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time, and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, the power of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That meant something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do you go from the digital world into the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move around, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose you said to you that, with only some changes in your genes, they might be able to improve the <unk> for more accurate and more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe be those people who wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably should have the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. It makes me feel good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination.
Or maybe that's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense to the light of the <unk>
But if effectively take biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the most interest of us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but in fact, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take on the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> they ask them about <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot, dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that they can want to be <unk>
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> to the <unk>
But, by that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help to digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we tell us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two stem cells.
But when organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have a confession to confess that when I was a college student thinking, well, you know, <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year he was going on, he had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90s, <unk>
And one night somebody hits her door in a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a beautiful tiny dancer <unk>
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
"It's fine. "I said, George, <unk> <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different aim at the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to be healthy.
I wanted to regain health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view you and I are like <unk> rockets that's designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think all of the <unk> the feeling that they put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily ask longevity.
It didn't necessarily take it to the biggest or the stronger and the <unk> and even the smarter.
Evolution led to the best <unk> creatures to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish burn easily in the empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's going on in evolution, and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the reasoning behind it would be that through medicine, in the first place, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that no longer is possible to have the isolation of the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that you can make a evolution of the traditional kind of traditional type, the dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> as a species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, and a possibility, and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that they <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first of us consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to individual and family level.
Think about it as if it could be able to choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to do the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to the cost of 20 to 20 dollars.
Not a lot of <unk> so that you can actually make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly in reach of all of them.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but are going to match them against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental test trial in course with the flu vaccine <unk> in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but and if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or changing the <unk> egg and giving their children a better chance of a healthier life, to remove the diabetes -- reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is also going to allow us to also adopt <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle faster than we can run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to become the evolution before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can give it to 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices as a society of a better society, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more <unk> or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what it might <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall <unk>
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had <unk> the plane, and we weren't very far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot ran the airplane on Hudson River.
That's not the road.
They <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then three words said three words.
The three <unk> words I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to get in, and I didn't do, all the fences that I wanted to convey all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the <unk> George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my errors have tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, I also give rise to my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that you can do in things that didn't matter with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with the people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to get away the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your watch clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die of that day.
And he gave me an <unk> that was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and living in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and for whatever it is -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you saying that they are still waiting to do because they think they're going to live forever?
How do your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that I <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her house after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work was influenced by me.
I have a design company and animation and animation -- so obviously, graffiti is intricate as we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are an important person, and you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Would anybody see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they go <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed myself with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I committed to her brother and her father there at that precise moment, "OK, this is <unk> Tony is going to talk, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to make his art again.
Because it's kind of ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside you can't <unk>
So I talked about a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research that has a technology that allows them to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks of Bush and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another one and a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the insurance companies and get a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "I don't know," this guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken off the squares of the walls and instead of <unk>
But for two weeks, we were going to go from <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a pair of cheap sun sunglasses that we buy on the walk of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> stuff and Radio <unk>
We take a camera that <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and you build one -- we published the code -- the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that doesn't have a limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital <unk>
Any person who has paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of training all the night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life, and it's looking through the support system of its life.
We ran away the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the hospital parking lot.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was going to say, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone would finally come to <unk> and he took me out of there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
So we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up from shutting down the <unk> is that April of this year in the middle of Los Angeles at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible as possible, as possible.
Nothing that there is in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had never done anything with recognition technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in very difficult situations and at the same time a very dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a <unk> <unk> mine.
<unk> in hot and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in large part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in the kind of appearance, and the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that we have to try to look at social issues of ways that we have to do interesting, and hopefully analyzing a way that looks <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights for my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good opportunity for you.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I had no certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten myself in situations horrible in the last few years, but nothing could me <unk> nothing could be <unk> for something that was so hard or as dangerous as you can go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that about the <unk> of goods and marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything at the bottom at the end, has computer images, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores this whole idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk>
I'm a <unk>
Was it <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> <unk> at the title, but we're going to make sure that we could use all the categories that we can in the film.
You may have a shoe and you get the most cool shoe you <unk>
The most great car you've driven in "The greatest <unk> ever <unk> the best drink that you <unk> <unk> from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the shot at beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how you go to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out to us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be me?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about the brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places to go.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so one of these companies were suddenly gone.
None of us wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the landscape of separate media is not the idea to tell with that new <unk> vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this one.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first pictures that are <unk>
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or easily detected or easily detected or easily <unk> or easily <unk> that are characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices -- the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to <unk> something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> --  -- like that rare bear that's still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to <unk> a story, but we have <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would <unk> me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go for my own, I would have to take it out to mediate and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to come up with a sudden -- which I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big big, giant <unk> and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies -- they say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was going to offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to make it solid, to <unk> to <unk> as it is.
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look <unk>
Karen <unk> We are a small brand.
<unk> to the smaller type of movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind you to give people the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
KF: That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category into positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It is <unk>
How do we keep us cool time, with better <unk> more <unk> times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> A single thing -- <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like dark colors, lots of gray gray gray and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing accessories like sunglasses, or I like <unk>
Woman: If Dan were a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Part of a hippie partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They provide toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little <unk> that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: He failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can get Tom, but I often <unk> me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings of your sense of being.
MS: These are a way to look at the world.
A: <unk> of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you think about how people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case it came from, and they start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be.
I like things different.
I like things weird stuff.
A: <unk> from the <unk> to what is that <unk>
What is the <unk> In which phase of <unk> you encounter now?
Why is it important to <unk> What's the <unk>
Let's get a little bit about that.
<unk> little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Big <unk> <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness for all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid the fear, those elements -- and you actually give them a <unk> and you get something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there's <unk> marks and brands care, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your identity, your <unk> personality -- what would be?
You're a <unk> attribute that makes your blood <unk>
Or are you a rather good <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being cool like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> quick or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or are you rather <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
Are you common, traditional <unk>
You're <unk> stable, beautiful, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how you now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire for both for commercial marketing centers like film.
We went to San <unk> where you have banned advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the road in schools in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the biggest response or the ones that I've been more successful are those in which I <unk> with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took back to their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, which is going to make people think about the people, which will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? They wanted to succeed?
Well, since the movie was sent out in the <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was sent out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we talk about to <unk> their clients not to be part.
I have always believed that if you would take risks, if you take risks that are in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you pull out the people of that you're pushing it into failure.
I think that when you train their employees in <unk> you're going to be preparing all their company to lack of rewards.
I feel that what happens to make progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we move forward, I think we have to give them a place of fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to stop transparency.
More than a little bit of honesty is going to go along a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: And so we've got on the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of TED, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my health care for TED next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that are controlling speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with a centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective computer virus used by an engineer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> entered the gray box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> I used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> these <unk> <unk>
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they went through very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> rat that didn't like our <unk> it wave, but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively <unk> in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working in that place: <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a <unk> power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better <unk> the target soon.
So we pulled away from the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two bombs and a little bit of a big <unk>
We also saw that they were very <unk> with people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the points for you to attack.
You probably even know how much they <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard the <unk> of <unk> it's complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code here.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at the principle was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures, and we tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential for the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a <unk> white must be a valuable, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> on an effort to go back to the nest <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
So I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
It gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
It wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been that after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would say to one single and same goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six water and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk> me.
There's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values of the sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and they provide <unk> which is still running during the attack, with fake data data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> <unk> in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine is <unk> you have to open protection tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And you don't have the <unk> no security system <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in an automobile factory plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that spread this payload with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It will be as possible.
And if you look at that, with what <unk> is with a mass destruction.
That's the consequence we face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the implications, and better than we're going to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, they really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> basis?
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in the other way, our problems would be even higher.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be <unk> and you give <unk> skills, or another one that will make users of a wheelchair pick up and go back and go back.
In <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different than something that you put in the morning, it gives you a big force, that you can also increase your speed, and help you for example, for <unk>
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other <unk> entities, <unk>
This is not an <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must carry on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with a foreign damage of a back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can rotate it 90 pounds of land on variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial <unk> to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of the wheelchair, about what I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people in the wheelchair, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very young people, very young people, with damage to the column that when they start their life -- to 20, 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We are also talking about the population that is increasing rapidly.
Your only option -- many times -- by a brain injury or some other <unk> -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who does 19 years ago he had a injury in the column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors in it.
Not fully <unk> in crutches that send signals to the board, here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and the knees, and they make them move through this soft and very natural ride.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, on the air, on the bottom of my life.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all the feeling and all the way back in the pelvis, down.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in the hospital in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you will never get <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
This is how they stole me to the last ounce of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even building on a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential to change life to future generations -- not just from soldiers, but to <unk> and all the users of the wheelchair, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know about his cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest living kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large guys, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where deadly violence hasn't been observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been <unk> for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also will put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat trade and deforestation are making it can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have frequent <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the world's lives is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game you see the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the humans.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in bonobos like humans.
And this video really is interesting because it <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing remarkable elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where it gets to wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female man, which is playing with the <unk> water.
I think, like that, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds inside and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world increasingly difficult to greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get down to the maximum game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate at play, they can be the moments where it's the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, to embrace this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers went to a highly qualified staff who has to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of it.
But still, there was a career against the other volunteers to get to the captain to go to the captain and find out what was our homework.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly crossed one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to Captain and he asked him to go back to the owner of her own house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a live <unk> only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go back home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and you bring this woman a couple of <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but <unk> I jumped on the stairs, at the end of the hall went to the firemen <unk> that at the same time or less had finished the fire and walked into the main fourth looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back around the ladder -- where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house -- the <unk> for the owner of the house where, as he expected, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the owner of the <unk> house by the brave <unk> to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at the next was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my <unk> <unk> I'm a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of the individual <unk> acts of the individual level.
And you know what I learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who've achieved, or they're to do remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: don't hold on.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something for giving, you get right now.
<unk> food in a dining hall, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the computer block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He called it a brick <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block, the <unk> in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows to create much greater circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think that building blocks of building our time are being reserved at experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, and motors and sensors.
And the best of all is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't put them in a wrong way.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange line is wire it.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make higher circuits.
One blue with one green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and we now have a <unk> light.
We <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program a very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower, just <unk> this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a <unk> <unk>
We want all of the interactions in the world to be attached to <unk> ready to use.
<unk> <unk> solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of <unk> who don't have an engineering experience, just in <unk> and paper and paper and paper and said, <unk> something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in reach of all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So let's go forward and stuff.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for getting involved with the <unk>
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on the side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm already given that time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> of Peace to <unk>
We had some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of the technology today.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant <unk>
Here you see as if I would look at a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody gets caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered with a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help from this <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that point, it was a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can adopt a <unk>
You decide <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case in this case he got <unk>
If you don't, someone can <unk>
I mean, you have a conflict component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the tiniest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads on viral.
This is responsible for a system of <unk> City, looking at this application that could use it -- not for snow, but for the citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people would steal the batteries.
That's why citizens <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just showed it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we can <unk> using it.
And this has spread without <unk> and naturally <unk>
If you know a bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen normally.
The software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that by the normal channels they would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the moment has taken over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days, and it spreads viral form, is a kind of warning shot at the U.S. <unk>
It suggests to the government better than work, not as in private businesses, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather than the Internet itself.
That is to say, without <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the government of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a lot of frustration in front of that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they <unk> the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they don't <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately led to us -- remember that <unk> <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of food care and information center.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined <unk> on official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started <unk>
And then finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house and put good music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a call center.
It has a mobile phone and a mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
They don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually comes this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if she's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet nights, <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical stuff.
And it's also a great example of the income to the government for distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a big example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
I connected to two people.
And it could be <unk> connected to the government services that we need but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call <unk> <unk> that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people <unk> but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entry into the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will support our values and make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow superficial layer.
It's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which is what keeps us that funded as something that operates on our against that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work -- we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who are <unk> in the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to look at the huge challenges that they face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go out without solving the institution that can act on behalf of everyone?
We cannot ignore government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to <unk> the government function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> only we have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members of our members is <unk> so I am, I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about, who are all going to talk about.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem face doesn't matter to make you hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set hands to the work to program applications that make them better work better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a fire hydrant, taking off <unk> dumping a garbage garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not just consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until they don't <unk> the citizen of it.
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here are impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that doesn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach that feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, she had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was tough but it was <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I'd come back to me, and I was approaching me and said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was <unk> again and if she said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and smile, but she was really serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, walked down the room, he took me from my hand and said, "Come on! <unk> we're going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget.
He took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you."
I said, "Okay, let's go.
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't say, <unk>
Then I went down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give you three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do, is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> you know, the <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
And I thought, "Yes, <unk> So I'll do it."
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do, is that you never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have a older year and a <unk> <unk>
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You <unk> All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister also.
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's wrong with you? Take a <unk>
I <unk> the stare at the force and said, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is getting <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they don't really make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner for <unk>
My whooping died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to her, we needed to be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so long, determined by these facts.
One of three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore <unk> Washington, Washington, <unk> of 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or <unk> freedom.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And it seems to us that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and <unk> make us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work with some kind of developments curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you get rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it at the next 10 years, the loss of the loss of rights will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they used to be sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, not a chance of getting away.
Right now we're in process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They <unk> people on death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way of how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent and <unk> and released from death <unk>
A mistake, <unk> an innocent rate in nine.
This is interesting.
So in aviation wouldn't ever allow us to fly airplanes if every nine you would have been <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classroom with students on history <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was an defined little bit of terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are more people who are coming up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell the talks, you give the talks, <unk> people to stop saying that in our history deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> and of <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
The whole time <unk> with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's rather disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
There are never going to be here."
The room was quiet in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our story, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we are <unk> and <unk> we started running people."
<unk> about this.
How would we be in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both together.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> those who never will come to TED.
Think of them it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
With innovation, with creativity, development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions for the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that even in communities as TED must be <unk>
There's no disconnect with technology and design, which allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, injustice.
Now I want to <unk> that these thoughts are a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege as a young lawyer who was very young, to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> the lady <unk> We're going to get it to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. Be <unk>
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going to just go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was standing there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, <unk> Give me this idea of justice <unk>
So what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end the sentences for life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We tried to do something about death penalty <unk>
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and at the end of me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got his finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I believe that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher than we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
But even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity of people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> that won't be judge by our technology, because of our design or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society is not because of the way they treat rich and <unk> but by how they treat the poor, <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> <unk> like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, which have been <unk> for them as adults were <unk>
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it is?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late at the wake of my God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't have, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should be asking for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He was 14 years old, a little, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my black client of 14 is treated as a <unk> <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there in the <unk> there were been <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only the <unk> he had been sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to cut this case, like stupid.
I got into the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went on the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. He walked to court.
I was going on the stairs when I met a black black man -- was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
So I approached it and <unk>
And I <unk> in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was linked into my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge came in.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, You wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> I <unk> And we started traveling.
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
They got the cops <unk> the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and I all agree because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I would come to see the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I would just look out the window and you <unk> to hear all that <unk>
It kept walking over here and there.
And finally, this old black man, with worry, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed up <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at the <unk> he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience room to tell this young man who would keep his view on the goal of <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think a lot of you can understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an <unk> desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your <unk> to do something.
Something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several close opportunities here.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will do an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in <unk> policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases, not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> are not at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that they were <unk> these funds to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that it has to do with the highest <unk> rate.
What would you say that is this?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not about crimes in violence.
It's the wrong issue against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let ourselves convince us the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain <unk> to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months <unk> could be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that the media media prefer <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses are receiving many, many more data than the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all of the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So in a <unk> of <unk> stories, looking at the <unk>
That old saying from the <unk> "If there's blood -- you know, it's very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going wrong on worse.
But it's probably not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps massive progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of the species, water scarcity and <unk> of water and <unk> <unk>
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just ended up with them.
Let's take it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita income is <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food for electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy spent 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to achieve every time higher <unk>
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, no water, <unk> TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> in the past, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the technology of information jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price on about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace in <unk> in depression and <unk>
It's the speed of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, the friends of <unk> call sensors and <unk> the robotics, 3D printing and networks, 3D printing and distribute personalized production on the whole planet, the synthetic biology, the fuel, vaccines and food, digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked in the newspapers the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, which is available for everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can be <unk> the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, it would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> <unk> story.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But King of <unk> ate with covered with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
For that reason the tip of the Washington Washington <unk> is <unk>
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth's mass -- it doesn't come as a pure <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
We <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of America, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan has written the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, then it was <unk>
<unk> a famous picture of how they <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes with nanotechnology <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to make it <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> already <unk> is the size of a small fridge in a little bit.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of water drinking to the day of any source -- seawater, water water, a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
President of Coke just thought that it will make an important test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it to <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation that is about this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And to count with a smartphone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video video, images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology, now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best way to get into health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device with which you speak, and because it has <unk> can <unk> you can get blood out of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device is a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't call to call the <unk> and the first place, to prevent the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of <unk>
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected together.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion of our minds have never seen before you add to the global conversation.
What's going to do these people?
What do you do? What do you want?
And instead of economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people are tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health with the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D <unk> and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of humanity, healthy polite <unk>
So what about voices never had to do before.
What if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and can act for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X <unk> is that small teams guided by their passion with a question of course, can do things that were before they could only make the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the <unk>
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this <unk> teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns of human patterns is better -- protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk> <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have over a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe I think I <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was very caught up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the shift from waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, of a <unk>
There was <unk> of about 20 <unk> the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he became more about the middle in Ghana.
When I was there, 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I took to five centimeters tall.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was no fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose into the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this pretty bad boat, pretty bad was called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish on him, and we did studies in southern China Sea, and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> I know now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And the majority of the fish are tiny <unk> about <unk> remains <unk> fish.
In short, sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then it starts the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living one.
I still wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect fishermen every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
We don't remember it, but we don't remember it.
I <unk> the starting point to start to start with, and the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, <unk> number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will be able to use the images by the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and the extrapolate <unk>
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the slide of change.
And at the end of the end of keeping you with the <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that don't are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals everywhere.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you who have to do, like Captain such and such watched a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally they don't use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the huge role that it can make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine <unk> we really actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been running and it's <unk>
That's for the people who can see a marine marine zone and can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the <unk> for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can actually fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a <unk> Bay simulation.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made of <unk> and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
It took over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of them, gets loads of visits and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the peak of popular summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that he <unk> the video to the <unk>
The creators of trends as Jimmy <unk> are present to us and new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday.  You all want it to come on a <unk>   You all want to get the weekend on the weekend.  KA: We will not think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Rebecca <unk> Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> -- this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> are also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a <unk> group will take a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big <unk> then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment in the 20th century, this communal engagement is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's like this, that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
And you saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that sparked between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an old version of the ancient one.
And then it was international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script could it have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video for minute, just that is really unique and unexpected it can make sure that these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of <unk> protest against <unk> to <unk> in New York, to admit that I wasn't very interested in me.
Casey <unk> I <unk> no longer <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent them properly at <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> got five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- in a new kind of media that we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the current means, but they <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother will never let me forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> assignment the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was investors, rape and death.
As most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would take it to my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> <unk> into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to <unk> for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and to the young man who collapsed and died, and I'll end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had later the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations, shaping a new new together.
We set up in <unk> a prehistoric class suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants from immigrants from immigrants from immigrants from <unk>
Unlike the middle class of middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English were traded between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car <unk> working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, they would not mind what you should be, which was usually <unk>
Two average pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were rare <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back again.
And where is we home where?
Something in me <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> every boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares could come to <unk>
She opened up a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the <unk> angry and <unk> and kids were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
They had been centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> <unk> <unk> with what I <unk> myself.
On the other other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of a lawyer -- I was elected the Australian <unk> of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges don't <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard was, and in homes whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the habits, and in the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- an grandmother, a mother and two daughters and two daughters will end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we got into the boat.
<unk> had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about youth and education and <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people of all the trails of life, many of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is okay to be a stranger, a <unk> -- new in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is being grateful, perhaps a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
It wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, and there was a little bit of the energy there, which is a weird mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, he was made a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
<unk> to <unk> at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we open up.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I just finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, he had a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause themselves, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The can't do it proved to be wrong.
He was in the shower in the room of a hotel in Sydney at the time when she died, a thousand miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were even with it.
The night a <unk> came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us were and how life <unk> we can now see that men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that to you know?
However, the privilege of the easy, the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in every wave, the steady rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them secure would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the former Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
So at that time when I <unk> the great prince <unk> I had <unk> and I took a bow off and with a <unk> on the floor, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that really struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow magic, don't kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of her.
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where are we in where we are.
They put up the text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we mean by that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for an iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic <unk> to those ideas that we <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always <unk>
So over here, we have to get the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light up your path in the <unk> of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with was that a whole galaxy was a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> which I <unk> towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of a fantasy book there has been no maps of static maps.
This is a map that goes larger, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points, the book is also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another extremely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and which is a contemporary thing.
These are the <unk>
We all have heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing back into a <unk> child history.
It's in a story that involves current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> <unk> to their <unk> have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure in which we need to go out on the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> stones, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So in order to regain this ritual of childhood you have to go out and, in one chapter, a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then can be put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside of the variants variations between magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through and through augmented reality, you see a <unk> group that appear on the inner plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves of leaves it.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will be <unk> with technology and magic and technology will come close to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We are getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that little bit of joy and love that we sat down through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was <unk> to a <unk> <unk>
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> <unk> we just stop listening.
This is my <unk> Wi-Fi is a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time in which I need to care about it, or some urgency of that thing, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers, on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before I get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity that will have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a device.
And people <unk> from their houses, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to recover control and be captains of their own <unk> but also it can help us care about health care because of the challenges we face as the firing costs of care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video.
We all have shipping controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk> are <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but nobody <unk>
No one knew where <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please have <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in a <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and in the next weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we wanted to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that you will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be messaging service or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share a picture of photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed up with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was at planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> highway <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to look like being captured in some way like photography.
I think you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real?
Are the details or the <unk>
Would the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is <unk>
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it were.
But, at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those ones that don't even <unk> the things around us in our daily lives.
But when you combine pictures is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos they combine must have the same kind of light.
And these two pictures do with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed by photographs of different places.
And in my personal staff, I think it's easier to create a place that is finding it because you don't need to <unk> the ideas that it has in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the <unk>
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made a red house house to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome of what I think it takes to planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you can see it can be very beautiful and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anyone who took from a courthouse.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing on the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on the <unk> scale.
In other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves -- it's a new thing.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are we <unk> curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some time unit, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to look at -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask for example, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation transport as fast as the past <unk> tomorrow could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development technology that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these curves. <unk> we see that they're not forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we're going to be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way you embrace the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition is very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
There is a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking away and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back a few two and a half billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around.
If we look at the way those chemical <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, it had floating around about oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical prescriptions in their inside.
Some of those blobs of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them put materials out of the outside and the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those <unk> of oil.
But those blobs weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random <unk> of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the droplets of some way will be <unk> being better at the time of putting the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things became interesting when these droplets learned the trick of <unk>
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution <unk> a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to record them.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living self is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> We can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide from the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if anyone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have taken it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
And writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then there was another big step in the way that things were <unk> very different and was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information as well as cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, were together in it, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was really successful all of the individuals in that community were <unk> more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities got so much that, in fact, that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the entire recipe for the community board in a DNA chain.
The next stage stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities, communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than process information in community.
It's neural structures.
<unk> are the devices that they process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> and understanding and transmitting information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave it an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary period of time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit, because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structure that they would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
And so the fact that the nervous system built these information structures really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting there emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy for mine.
But we took something very complicated to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do abstractions.
We now go through periods similar to organisms like <unk> <unk> our <unk> methods -- presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape, <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And we've now accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history that I told you took billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
And then the language of language, took less than a million years.
And <unk> like the electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up your own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process is <unk>
But I get to make the life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that we use to <unk> would not be possible without the historical <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to engage in a conventional way.
I don't know that each transistor makes each transistor
There are billions.
And instead of that, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, put it on the machine and the machine with that something that you could not could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method, I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process operating on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million <unk> sequences.
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to come up to the numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that I best did the <unk>
They <unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I <unk> the ones that are better than the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will <unk> those kinds of programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please do the <unk>
<unk> again.
Some mutations are <unk>
And it tries again and tries to bring it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or a few minutes, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with shows that we would have programs that are absolutely perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to <unk> it to see how they work.
These are dark programs that are strangers.
But they do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the target because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were doing it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls out a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make some different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who tries to throw it at the first base, doesn't get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who is 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the <unk> <unk> player in the <unk> <unk> on a regular season.
Now I would play this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they meet a surgeon that has also a <unk> record.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose you live in a remote place, and one being dear has two <unk> <unk> and their family family is coming to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But know what?
She's getting improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think should be the average of hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, OK.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is send them into the world, and I include the mandate to be perfect.
Who never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied for a blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> <unk> Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything from memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> of <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if you were to <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or as much as I can, close to everything, because this is how I got rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady <unk> to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I applied to a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist going into that patient.
We report to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gave me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of taking the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
And I did this and I started working on the treatment that I was <unk>
We gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> water <unk> so that it could be <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent him back home.
In fact, I made two more mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and did what I should have done, which was to call my chief and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to give up information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that I would pay care for.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to make sure that I could take care of my patients without even touching my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I sent her home, I didn't take attention to a voice in my inner side that I would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure as I asked the nurse that I was taking care of the lady <unk> "Do you think he's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high school and the ambulance together with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in our stomach.
But I kept working with my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. And I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did.
I went through the emergency service of the emergency service.
And there another nurse, not that I was being cared about from the old lady before, but another one, I was told by three words, those three words that most emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists who fear them too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: does you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse in <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
So after an hour I had come to her house, after I had a <unk> and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
barely breathe and was blue.
<unk> personnel all their resources.
They gave medication medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> up to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and expected against all hope that they <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that I never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
and in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And by the ninth day, they left her to go, <unk> wife, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few weeks I was excited about it, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't stand up with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was that we are bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would get the things to do the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did <unk>
Little at little that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day, <unk> opened up the sky, and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I'd felt better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I took care of efforts to be perfect to make more mistakes, I would make away from those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency room in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a man of 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He took him penicillin and sent him back home.
But as he ran the door still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he said the three words: You remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can <unk> at Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but from the upper Air <unk> and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He fortunately, they don't <unk>
They were <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
I <unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it was normal. A colleague who was checking the patient perceived to be some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
And I checked it up and see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called a surgeon.
Both were operated together and they recovered well.
But every single case I <unk> <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't be a <unk> and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> I will tell you what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this for that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me that I would have difficulty looking at it in your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that say they can't sleep and the ones that you can't sleep and the ones that have <unk> <unk> and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we give the medicine to the people that make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study for bad health and medical <unk> to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes are happening every day, in which one in 10 drugs -- <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where bacterial infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> and <unk> and death.
In this country, they die <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system, where knowledge is going to multiply every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes with <unk> eyes and breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars, not <unk> their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we remove all the professional professionals who are likely to mistake, well, wouldn't anybody go away.
And with respect to people not want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art -- this is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students <unk> <unk> <unk> head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to be able to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> physician is human, you accept it, and they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it was trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everyone <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human <unk> <unk>
And I feel a lot of it, but I just strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three <unk> <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose for a week?
And I did a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says to pick an average American, it's about 70 to a day.
Not a lot of a long ago in a research followed for a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives and the time that we were going to make decisions about making decisions with those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about his choices.
Do you know how many of them in the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do we figure out how to deal with those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to meet your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for you for a <unk>
And now my first question on the day -- you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this supermarket <unk> very, very <unk> at least in that era was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of the <unk> <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asking myself, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf from oil from <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> <unk> who came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager to the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists who came up every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>

They had different kinds of different classes.
I put a post on the <unk> right at the shop.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we looked at two things: First of all, where people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 percent that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
This is the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when there was only three percent came to buy <unk>
If there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, let me decide we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> but it's less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the frequency of the choices affects us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we look at the decisions about savings for retirement from about a million Americans, from among about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of money funds available to retirement, the <unk> program, <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of funds, it was less participation.
So if we look at the extreme ends, you see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of involvement was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And on plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of involvement went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choices, more people <unk> to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As long as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences by giving more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is, you know, the decision, that <unk> even when this is in versus self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though I see it will leave them better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant array of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choosing that awesome <unk>
Today I want to <unk> four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've never heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to be able to cut, you get strange <unk> you will have strange <unk> there will be an increase on sales, <unk> costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> just eliminated the products for the <unk> of cats that are less <unk> they scaled up <unk> in <unk> for two higher sales and lower costs.
You know that supermarkets, of today, they give <unk> <unk> products.
In a grocery store we have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a type of tomato sauce.
In the finance world, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to manage the choices is the <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard.
All employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically to a safe <unk>
They really want to choose from, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences you have between those options.
And if your employees can't afford them, you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that they would be willing to offer people in this audience a little vacation with all paid the world's most beautiful <unk>
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you about seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give them a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
<unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really hit your own <unk>
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the second <unk> but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technical technique to drive the problem of the frequency as it is <unk>
For people to understand the difference between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences should be very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why do people spend 15 percent to 30 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out that it looks more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting exactly how we were <unk> we did a little <unk>
So what we added was we asked the staff to think about the positive things that I would spend in your lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can run more categories than the options.
For example, this is a study we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the <unk> <unk> exhibit can contain from <unk> different types of <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This framework framework is totally useless.
<unk> have to tell you something that we <unk> not to the <unk>
And you often see this problem with these huge funds.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot of information than we think, if just <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity of <unk>
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a car manufacturer of cars that allow them to <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that each offers each.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order that makes the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
What in you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that are going from many options to time, <unk> the default button over and over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, many choices to many, there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order of the order of information.
If we start the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of the change does not say anything about the preferences of <unk> <unk> in all ways they are being made for choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building on now more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternatives -- <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can run more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help handle the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in your own business, or for the people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful at the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the <unk> in East Germany, if you had a writing machine, I had to get to the government.
We had to register a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of <unk>
If they were writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much of the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print one page, that will end up having some yellow dots on each page that are still a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to get a lot of fun for this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of Kiev, in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media using <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret secret service, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us being victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong on the worse.
In the future, most of the crimes will happen online.
The second group of <unk> in relative today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate them to <unk> them.
Groups like Anonymous has <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> the criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that they do for protest and the last group are the United States, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack.
<unk> is an authority to board the Netherlands or actually, it was.
<unk> last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and take a <unk>
Last week, I said, at a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they were to <unk> death of people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die because of a attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> the <unk>
So what are the <unk>
Well, you need to have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except for <unk> an foreign <unk> authority.
and the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt <unk> the headquarters for the <unk> secret police on April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications for the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
We even have tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it looks bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be able to trust our governments today in 2011, any right that will be <unk> today, will be forever.
Do you know, <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we might have in 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
<unk> are warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is why there's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A boy in my community, at age nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions gave them fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping lions to see the pen further.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions to believe that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were left, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing isn't moving, it's always like --  So jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the light and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery down, and the battery will reduce the electricity into the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give up the outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how lions see it when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions so that you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got a problem with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You <unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've set up in seven houses in my community and they're serving so much.
And my idea also is used now for all of Kenya, to frightening to other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using to be <unk> for the farms.
And because of this <unk> I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
They even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So one year ago, I was just a kid in the <unk> of the savanna the <unk> the cows of my father, and used to see airplanes fly, and I was telling me that one day would be within one.
And here I am.
I got an opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer in aviation and a pilot when they grow.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and to the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you've got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next thing in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a near electrical <unk> CA: A near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electrical <unk> but I want to do my own.
CA: So you put it up once, right? <unk> -- I've tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: And I got a <unk>  CA: At the <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every single step as a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague of my sister.
That he said, "When <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at his face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine will <unk> North Korea to the <unk>
Over one million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all my stuff around was completely dark at night except for the lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I was always asked why they had light and us not.
This is a picture of North Korea from North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Africa to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous because the North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested for Chinese police, and I was <unk> in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said to the questions.
At the end of the day, a official said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North China is <unk> in <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police, and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> were eventually released after an international pressure.
These Koreans didn't get so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity -- I've decided I'll risk by going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different from 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the college.
Just as I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities were <unk> some money that I sent to my family, and because my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately, immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took one flight to China and went to the border to North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went down several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and sentenced for a Chinese police officer.
He was asked to ask them all of them, and he started asking you questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything because I did all of my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the <unk> <unk>
I was walking in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family, and for other two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I read her with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"Not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village to <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when they <unk>
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs it.
Eventually, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But the freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language, labor <unk>
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North North North Koreans around the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, <unk>
So the city planners gathered together and thought, we're going to change the name of South <unk> to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South <unk>  <unk> <unk> food, <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a desert of food -- Los Angeles Center for home places to drive and eat in the car.
What's curious about is that places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was missing to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house you see the effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as cars <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I already got tired of taking 45 minutes back and forth to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land strip we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet to three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> and we started planting our food forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we're kind of a group paid for <unk> made by gardeners of all the <unk> of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone is <unk>
The city stood up on top of me, and in <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my yard, the <unk> became the <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
One order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the written story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the Green members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk> land.
It's about 68 miles away from <unk> land.
That's 20 Central Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million plant plants.
Why on Earth does it not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars to be a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Center.
I grew up there. Tell my kids there.
I was <unk> to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to show you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Maybe as an artist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do, if they leave their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how kids affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion that came a mother and her daughter, were like <unk> at night, and they were in my front garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people go to steal your <unk>
And what I say, <unk> I don't fear that you're going to go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at its time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refuge in the middle of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was a fabulous to see how it changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If kids grow up <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If they grow tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of this are being taught if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and your body, eat the blind you will put them in front of.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that you're caught. I see kids who are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids that are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't <unk>
I'm not talking about free stuff, because they're free not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work with people, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk> is.
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take them to take their <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you don't call me if you want to see me, don't call me if you want to sit on a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very <unk> <unk>
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, in which it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in asphalt than <unk>
And especially if you go inside your bike and these cars go that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road in the world.
The solution for that is to make roads in asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the Netherlands, of the Netherlands, have pores and water can go through it, so all the water water flow on the sides and will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't <unk> water.
The noise also disappear.
Because it's very <unk> all the noise in it, so it's a very quiet road here.
It also has some disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this highway <unk>
What is <unk> See that in this road the stones on the surface are <unk>
First of all, a stone, then several more and more and more, and then then -- well, you won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> like I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if you were <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you will move the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use <unk> of steel, that to clean up <unk> and we can cut out the wool of steel in tiny pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have the asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk> on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially steel, very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are attached to the surface.
I used an <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here on the stage.
The microwave <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the <unk>
So we tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we tested it in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the interest then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they can double the life of the surface. It really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, you're curious about this, this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool cool first before I can show you how they can repair it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news usually <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they made the girls in school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to get my eldest sister -- who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so it looks like we go shopping.
The school was at a house over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead, the school was suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my foster mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not educating their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember that there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can help leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, you will do.
So you still want to not <unk>
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate at <unk> College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't only get rid of my college title, but I was also the first woman, and I am the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who drove me through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, like my friends, <unk> for them, despite the face of the opposition <unk>
As a <unk> It's not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went off from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would get him to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but we don't harm the future of my daughter for your old <unk> <unk>
What I've realized, about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter, and that he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> girls who went to school being told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes don't get a lot, after the retirement of the U.S. <unk>
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and <unk>
And to me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day, the girls of <unk> I was <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk>
But you will never come back with a revolutionary <unk>
They've been nearly two years since the revolution was <unk> inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with a lot of other <unk> citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of <unk> and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> <unk> in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses of about 50 thousand people, we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a <unk> transition to democracy and national reconciliation, democracy.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique <unk> I started to organize workshops about the development of skills and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of women and for our right to <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> than <unk> the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
<unk> our initiative was successful and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, recently, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we were developing news news.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the government officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and his <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made up of a radical mindset -- and it's removed from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all here at all with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to admit that we, as a nation, choosing evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't brought the peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The list was <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why are our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men as women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than I needed the election, which just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's performance representation of female <unk> which is most likely to need <unk> <unk>
We need to stop acting as outrage, and to call them days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not just <unk> but also putting the mercy of <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that was Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately needs to reach the end of the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interconnection of the female <unk> and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we can do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> <unk> the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions, has the same root in Arabic, that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that spans all of the humanity of men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so as the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all of us.
This is what it says, "My mercy to all the things."
This is what it is, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That to everybody <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a <unk> question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody is <unk> Why is she left?
Why would anybody stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just met at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I thought I was creating my alma mater, <unk> me with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, the man who loved one person in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be their story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have a MBA in <unk> from the Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm nearly 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, every religions, every single income income and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long duration of the road, the last place we wanted or said, in the families, the last place we wanted or expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be staying with a man that hits her, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of age 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence victims than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or the patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, rainy night night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York in New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college college university, and I was working on a very important Wall Street.
But what impressed me on that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it all over the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- that I had gone to Harvard, who had gone to Harvard, I would get passion in helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like anyone had ever done.
And it was because of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving my dreams of my dreams, but I thought I had to make any sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was getting into a head of a financial trick, and a financial and psychological trick, rather <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how it reacts with it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe for three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
And another one of the others kept under the pillow on our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in a small kid.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never had my hand, my life was serious risk every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I put my mother with my mother and married him with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that I was making a family with me.
It was an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent two times more on our <unk>
The first time I was driving out to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in my head and he <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our <unk> of honey in the traffic and threw a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> continued to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Disease Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why is I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and he was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face his <unk>
The other question that everyone does is why they simply don't <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people, because we get the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence is happening after the victim has finally put the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources, and engineering the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not to go to the man who <unk> his mother.
And yet we're still asking why it's not going to go.
I was able to <unk> because of one last <unk> because to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told everyone to the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and familiar to all of my friends, all of my friends and I am here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are it <unk>
For some people who are a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them, and that <unk> their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, fully free lives of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence survivor.
I got married with a kind of cute man and you have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to have ever more, would never, ever be a <unk> <unk> pointed at my head from someone who says I will.
Right now, like you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid people <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people, who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting their daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my <unk> a particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse just in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need to all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the <unk> to the light talking about it with your children, your coworkers and family and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> who should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a awkward tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed like this.  luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first set of clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck in <unk> I think.
So if some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go back now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These grads are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my mind.
All right.
So why have I done that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I've changed totally what you thought about in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend in real life.
And the photographer was totally <unk> and the photographer told me that he <unk> my back, and he <unk> the hair of the child.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do to transform our aspect, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model of this.
Because I'm a nice, white, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how does it be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> it was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic <unk> and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I have known to leverage money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York, I told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- that is less than four percent, not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Is it going to be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then what I would really say to each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> head of the American journal or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
Saying you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a copy of the jobs on your back, no matter what <unk> is, you know, you want to be the president of the United States, but your C.V.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering a personal field, but it was a child.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team, and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to do it for free?
I have too many inches of 20 inches and I never use, except for the couple before, but the privilege that I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up at Cambridge, and I was one and I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped with a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a <unk> agent in order to keep going.
I looked at these privileges and I looked at not what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way regardless of who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, from the teenagers who were pair and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, for what for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times <unk>
By doing this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States, they don't like their body, and that figure comes to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask is, "How is life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you know is, if you're a little thinner and you have the smartest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give them an answer that maybe I would read it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious people.
And that's true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask them, with some more thin legs and the smartest hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a team group, because they have the <unk> legs and the brighter legs and the <unk> but probably be the physically <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of race and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that is holding out of this talk, I hope that everyone will feel more comfortable at recognizing the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures -- and I wasn't me who <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum of care in lighting.
In fact, most were taken out tourists <unk>
My story starts when, <unk> in New York to give a <unk> my wife brought me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and <unk>
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you leave you to New York at a <unk> journey, and you follow the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask tourists you were going to get the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time on a week of October and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only the physical level, but in every single way.
Because, as long as we took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion every year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, she stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> shop that <unk> from little previous <unk>
And it described to me that there was meaning to the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered his heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out of a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls out the picture.
I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't try to get somebody and asked, you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, <unk> like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> -- these are the attributes that they associate with the <unk> Parliament. But I don't accept it.
Don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament can't clean the environment.  <unk> are not helping prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are largely in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 are 11 percent of the risk of extinction.
So why do you <unk> are important? First of all, they provide vital services, <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria and they help absorb the anthrax that they wouldn't be by they would spread and cause large losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has a huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and under Egypt.
In the Hindu <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, it's very important <unk> to open <unk> and in places like Eastern Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they are being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for <unk> in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs have a huge time bomb, you know, the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They are <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so it will focus on a housing problem, it's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we make.
How can you help? It can become active -- to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you what we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> <unk> and Somalia. In Somalia.
I worked for an NGO NGO and every project that we set in African Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we <unk> <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with <unk> seeds in the south of <unk> to this absolutely glorious <unk> which goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach the local <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work -- and sometimes they didn't go to work, and we were amazed that the local people, in such a valley, hadn't had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking them how it was possible that we were not going to do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling them the <unk> look at how easy it is.
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, why don't we have agriculture up here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought that we just was Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then I saw what the American did, what they did, what they were doing the English ones were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's look at the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we are telling the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western partners, we have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any different culture like my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So the whites in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for <unk> who said for <unk> if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first of the help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane, on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided for the 27 years to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you would never come to a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does it do? You <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and they sit with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a bar. We put together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, at one time, <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have been identified.
So planning has this very blind point.
The smartest person in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work with one, and we work face-to-face face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family family, the family of the business, the family of the business, that <unk> with you in your house, at the coffee table, and help you find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> of Western Australia, of Australia, of Australia, right?
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask: "How can you do that?
How do you do that?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most compelling business business of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an <unk> company.
<unk> is the kiss of death in the U.S. spirit.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you <unk> You have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people and intelligence and passion?
What talk are you going to do with you more than this morning.
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossil fossils and a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that was in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people -- and I would say about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States arose -- <unk> <unk> <unk> companies.
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they will not come to speak with you.
Then you have to offer an absolute, <unk> service <unk>
And I would have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company, has to be able to do three <unk> things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with fantastic <unk> and you have to tell a great financial support.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies in the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world are common -- only one: No one was started by one person.
I don't know the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in bars with their dedicated <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what somebody made by this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much paid my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we lend and borrowing more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do you share more of our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust myself in a city.
It always <unk> the music.  There's a parade in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of American <unk>
I live near this house and I thought how could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot of death in death.
And this was a profound gratitude for the living time.
It gave clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But <unk> for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to stay on the day and to forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old friends and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted about her phrases for <unk> "Before they died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they died, I want to be judged by <unk>  Before they died, I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before they died I want to sing for millions of people."
Before they die I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before they died, I want to give you one other time.
Before they died, I want to go to the <unk>
Before they died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people who made me laugh at <unk> <unk> and they gave me comfort in tough times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in ways new and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and we change ourselves.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit and now have walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distraction it is more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is a brief and delicate life.
<unk> is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we have been ready for death is one of those things that we become more power.
You think about death in the <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care about as individuals and as community and more means to share hope and more means to share hope and the stories that surrounds us cannot only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
It doesn't speak, but it brings better joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love is.
They share it -- they pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at color color.
They don't care about religious differences and note this: it's never <unk>
When singing song from our childhood, trying to tell the words that I can't even tell you, reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel she's 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> memory <unk>
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, you pee on my arm during the first episode of <unk> and <unk> birthday.
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing: who were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those more familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, they will be diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that fast increases in the world, there's no cause <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> living and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would be <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences became more <unk>
But beyond <unk> the frustration and hyperactivity <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a child who looked at the world without <unk> a human being that I had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, moments that I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about <unk> communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be a regular thing.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences you <unk> It's a <unk> Each of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, and their big <unk> and their great unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when she fell through the hole in the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
<unk> I felt when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key thing to open that door is a great communication.
We need a desperately great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges and energy care and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
They don't tell us simply to study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same as making silly ones.
On the contrary, as Einstein, said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly its science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk>
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's actually supporting too much in the language of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple, <unk> line, that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key <unk> that can help the other open open door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all means, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that seeks a public <unk> no matter <unk> <unk> and that, when he wins, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said to the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the unlikely name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted with Parliament <unk>
They brought him into the Tower of London and he <unk> him, but he had the courage to cope with them, and at the end, it had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first set of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington <unk>
They didn't know.
How would you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proven quality.
And they weren't even <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by a fixed drive.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone was <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
The <unk> and the <unk> was that the Kansas House was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King if he would give him or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give the title of the most <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> that came to them.
And that title was <unk>
President. The title did not invent the title. It was already before, but it only meant <unk> that he <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious degree with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to keep waiting for more years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to suggest to you, it's that President President of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to note, the largest economy economy and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have <unk> to the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, looked at it, well, it was a <unk> for then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the 5,000 nuclear heads and so forth.
So, at the end of the end the Senate I won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now is the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but really, reality change a lot more the words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with <unk> tools.
Like others, I've been wearing a cheap flashlight of light -- she holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops to hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and <unk> <unk> in that <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep back of that hole at the risk of their lives without paying a reward and, often, dying.
I walked out of that hole and went home but they might never will. Because they are <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the Mexican Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
So we started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as grade.
When we ended up talking to me very sad, I honestly was to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> and, weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey started my journey to slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
A few of them considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of displaced Africans throughout the entire slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer <unk> was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars.
However, today you can enslaving entire families for generations for <unk> <unk> for 18.
<unk> slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery works in the <unk> the <unk> goods produced value, but those who produce them are disposable ones.
<unk> exists in most the world, and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This weird and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
We <unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> into trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There were no feed to eat, nor to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned down too hot in touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it." Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't civil of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to trust <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and he trusted you to <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles on <unk> land to trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge them and the children <unk> them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made out of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been like this whole life.
They have nothing with what to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk> their houses.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, they advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sexual <unk>
It led me to some stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for forced <unk>
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of just seven -- they're forced to <unk> and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
From foot in <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what will be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where they <unk>
There were no <unk>
There was no windows enough to <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and because they played a difficult topic, it is important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
So recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are other activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk <unk>
This is a family portrait here.
The black hands are the <unk> the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We didn't have <unk> they said.
We still hope yet to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest <unk> lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to have a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two older, two older kids, some more young kids, some more young children, made sense of it?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families and they were forced to work on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me, I was <unk> I think his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of the trees of the <unk> <unk> in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they were thrown into the water to release the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
Fortunately, I love it is not going to flee and as the entire life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it is the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working since the <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And I will point out that these networks are weighing over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi <unk> in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of slavery.
Kofi <unk>
Who will be because of someone decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners -- the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his <unk> suddenly sped up and matched our car and touched the window.
He asked us to do it for a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver that was very quickly.
Then he pointed out this path to just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go back, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found out that the road was <unk> for the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of the clear, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and everyone was full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children strapped on their back, and while they were looking for gold, they were <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry on stone heavy stone bags that then will be <unk> to another area where they were able to get the gold out.
To the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the side, the margin we see at least <unk> and also to children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took it to work with him in mines.
When you die her uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle that will force him to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, he had worked on the 1980s 14 and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so severe the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet to do that, he's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he will have been liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light about slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them and that we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day I happen to think about these beautiful beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images bring a force in those who you see, in people like you, and I hope that force turns on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do the applied mathematics and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> is like the management Parliament.
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demand for a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably a certain initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, <unk> this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at their time, was a ballet <unk>
In the last few years, this is a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know -- if there's really a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not <unk> That's why they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test <unk>
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to <unk> as conventional not conventional to try to, in a certain sense at least we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows somebody healthy as it makes sounds like a <unk> <unk> we can imagine as dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that we have for example.
And as <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as it <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affecting the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of string <unk>
We see the same <unk>
Take a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do they compare these exams based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
These are both <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something happens to be so <unk> appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals.
We can reduce our patient <unk>
I would not need to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get the objective data.
We could make it massive <unk> for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these targets.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call it under the price of a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So then <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and you can do it in different circumstances it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors looking for real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on mobile phone network as well, what we <unk> the project. We now have 99 percent.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the dark, in rooms with no windows and so large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin -- even more perfect -- we make it impossible, and we would focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a true taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I went to <unk>
It's a little fishing town in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level <unk> reached over 24 feet tall and more than three square miles the land.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
It <unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the sludge out and left the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory there.
We <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like their neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> <unk> and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
They <unk> and take them to different places from around the villages of around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those photos represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As he was fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center.
I helped clean the toilets, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the town where the <unk> center was <unk> the photos.
And they had the honor and I had the honor that that day would be <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some people who had over a hundred years in the lab, and I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came up with more pictures, and they needed more <unk> and so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were going to <unk> a neighbor to Northern <unk>
Once the week we use our scanner in the <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on of course of the photos.
I could make an hour. I could make weeks.
I could make months.
This <unk> had to draw just by hand using a guide <unk> areas whose color and the detail had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures would end up of bacteria, with algae -- with algae, even with oil, with the way of time I continue to <unk> it was a very important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the picture unless I was clean dry and had been <unk> by their <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As a time <unk> the leader of my group is like doing a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky enough to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she did it, but she stopped when he noticed the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked up their photos shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble very far away from where she used to be their house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not as small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
It took a week to find his whole family and knew that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her her photos his son under 14 years.
For her, despite all this, these pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could remember from the past that could remember the past day that was not marked in the last day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 6,000 volunteers had joined up there <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> pictures -- the great <unk> -- most of the <unk> of their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and fully <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would expect, but the first thing that we would take to look for.
This is what the project is, to restore little bits of humanity, to bring someone out of their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger, to bring something, using your talent for something that won't be thin skin models.
So to finish the end of it I'd like to read this email. He sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, I was <unk> because a beautiful picture of my family my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few basic needs of our basic needs.
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> was inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and really defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch on it in a <unk> or it <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in various <unk> to create a bunch of photons from just a millimeter <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet <unk>
If we take that bullet and this pair of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons go inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember that all this happens at less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a bunch of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> on the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the front pot, and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table, and because of the insights of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a regular <unk> and current and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit to see that film?
One day? Actually a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- of a bullet slow in motion.
And what about proving <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full <unk>
But if you look at this <unk> you will realize that, as the light <unk> the tomato <unk> is still <unk> Don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on your inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at <unk>
Like photographers, you know, if you take a <unk> picture, it comes very little light.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest <unk> so just to go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> it in an interesting way.
Superman can it fly.
Other heroes can become <unk>
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, and you will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in a slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capacities alone.
It has very good time resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
By projecting a laser you can record a picture of <unk> which, you see on the screen, doesn't really make sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we look at <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things for exploring before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the curve,
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light windows and open windows by the open.
Or we could build <unk> that could be able to see the inside of the body by doing <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But, of course, because of the fabric and the blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually an order to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization of visualization to solve the problems in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, he turned science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected are not just for just for scientific visualizations but we can see that we can.
We create a new form of computer photograph with slow motion and <unk>
And look at those waves remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a funny thing to do.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, I would have loved effects to see this image.
The order that happens in the world are sometimes invested in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a smartphone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, you know, <unk> to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that town.
Here you can see hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in search of change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these <unk> people who are looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who here are a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk>
It's a lot of a lot of people today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me today about my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that data there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. introduced a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, every single Internet provider of all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their <unk>
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers <unk> all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany, East <unk>
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your mobile phone?
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which Please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make it a lawsuit and I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the <unk> an agreement.
They <unk> the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court -- <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD in the inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty <unk> <unk> 30 <unk> of information.
I first saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file. OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life on this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, "I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go back and go forward.
You can see every step I want.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First of all, like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and then we end up with this great communications network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks with whom, who sent an email to who, this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who they were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And therefore, the fall of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and business agencies want to store so much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to <unk> for forever.
But the <unk> and live in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for every day.
When you go home to tell your friends that privacy is a <unk> value of the 21st century, and it's not fashionable anymore.
When you go home, tell your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store of you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that you can remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> nor can it <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I will tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
We go a walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping mall, drive in circles and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. <unk> is only one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm in Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I can.
Many people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters are <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents <unk> the school system and <unk> that I was also going, and if I didn't get all the maximum note every day, I had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk five years by putting my <unk> on her feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used to use was just hang a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of taps.
By growing up, there was only six Arab in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
People that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating food, so I <unk> the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were wearing <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of <unk> I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if I don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> <unk> us in <unk>
On the summer vacation holidays often my father tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> <unk> warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> <unk> went at yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I made yoga he was a <unk> comedian that he couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can <unk> in your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through social discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> in the theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the maximum note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl who was <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the <unk> I <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying historically, historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me because they believed that I couldn't do the stunts scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the <unk> I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the fact that I had literally been born and gave a actor without any <unk>
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with disabled actors for <unk>
When I went back home, and my first tour tour <unk> was as an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> he didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that my directors were not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with disability.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, I took comics comics from New York to New York to New York City, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that led to the first comedian that led to high speed on the <unk> of New Jersey with a driver who had a <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little <unk> <unk> that women are not fun, and they find that fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier to fight the <unk> challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went as I was invited to the news program, it has got it back to Keith <unk>
I came up as if I went to a graduate dance, I was <unk> to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I teamed up with the desk of the reader to not go out on the screen during the <unk> and when the interview ended, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was like <unk> at full time and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never got away from me or even as a child or a child.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
You can play online clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite example: <unk> <unk>
What disease is that?
We should really be praying for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But having grown up with the media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> fewer hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need all of our society to teach our children.
My brief, journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> at the grand state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugee kids a little bit of what my parents would <unk> me.
It was the only time my father saw me in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid from a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This town is about <unk>
<unk> drives the small town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no opportunities, no job, no work, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you get a guy who offers him to take it to <unk> after dinner in <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little money to buy new clothing -- money to send home to your family.
I presented to a young lady.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a car bomb.
That child from that small town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization connected to Al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that stuck.
This was the first thing that took him "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeat in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the <unk> Indian young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of access to <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They're not doing practically anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen it forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually in order to support some juvenile leaders on a business edge.
<unk> about 90 leaders juvenile <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because he was a college college student, frustrated, was the perfect white <unk> for <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the highway system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
A <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who they normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is somewhere going to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
So why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate <unk> and I think the corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool in <unk> in <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
A company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in houses, and the businesses of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, you can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, its innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
The forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So then, inspiring young people and create a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to guide them into development and put in their business.
<unk> to young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to the creation, and you will be <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create social impact.
Mohamed isn't simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park. This is how it calls it when it is created, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids on the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> paralysis of <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation and more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of <unk> an area <unk> north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and it won't be on the path that we <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings on top of that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> and a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> <unk> with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of aluminum paper and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they had <unk> who thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question kept with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
Does it matter like <unk> or where it <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of <unk> our garbage, for <unk> tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to meet as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked around their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working like <unk> of trash.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you can get very quickly <unk>
It costs a lot of getting used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies are still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You are coming up and moving into traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also, the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the trash <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a breathing way of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I think that the <unk> <unk> are the most important work of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective form every day, this starts <unk> from its <unk> and their dangers inherent in real ways.
We had controlled for decades and centuries they start to come up with <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then there is what I call our everyday average speed.
So I mean by simply the speed that we used to move in the <unk> time.
We usually don't <unk> or <unk> and we carry with us our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forgot about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side to take on it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that may help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow they keep behind us except for ourselves, of our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 2001, 2001, I heard <unk> of a <unk> truck in the street, grabbed my little son out and went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the garbage collection and went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we work together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have in account all the costs, even the real human cost of the work.
The city waste that we think about when we talk about garbage is three percent of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing that you see someone whose work is to clean the garbage of you, you know, a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking in our communal life to be part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects here as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this is not going to happen because it's about a climate temperate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And third, the aspect of it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure of the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building a lot of stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And in addition to two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, linking all the entrances of the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the open air in the building that <unk> by its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the input from the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from dresses of <unk>
They have the fractal geometry of the fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these small colors of colors that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what we <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the shopping center because in the end of the mall there were more local to sell.
And in addition to the idea of the facade it was a huge <unk> not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to <unk>
So we get certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity turns out almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk> <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan master plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so large, the biggest thing that I have, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve <unk> doors connected with almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets, creating 12 early blocks and features that in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some <unk> points to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell of the project as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best guidance for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So I <unk> a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the plant <unk> we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local rules that set up greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to space busy building construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and forth and do activities like running a two kilometers in the morning, or jumping from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect the nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
There was great amounts of hair, and a nice <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I got my sinister plan.
One day I was a time after the <unk> of school, he was a little afternoon, and I was <unk> in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked in the classroom, I took on the classroom, I took the book of grades.
And then I did.
I will give the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All of the things --  And I signed up to restore the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other classmates had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, without any imagination.
I got all rows of <unk> and myself a row from that, just for being there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt good at me.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's all the obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by this little girl that was so small to <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause for numbers of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we observe hearing, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because <unk> are like the laboratory in which <unk> <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> there would be the literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king, <unk> and <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I <unk> the high school <unk> because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> it almost has all of them.
This year to be 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the most <unk> study of <unk> the most <unk> study of the sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> and my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think in a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forgot about how <unk> it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
So let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, their wish, their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being time as <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give it to another one, maybe right now."
And he starts to say himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> senses in his lover -- it adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of <unk> and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well, the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover then <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research in real <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, a really painful truth, in fact, to what <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways of the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to, that makes us suffer, it causes us to have a much deeper feelings of feelings and vital that a wise man who can <unk> us.
We're telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No, I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion -- we <unk> our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird about that man who doesn't <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or do they accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how they <unk> them to do with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more <unk> the more we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead to doing violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the case eight years old, <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan was captured by having created a fake note on Facebook from the one that would send messages to <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For a year. It's a year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when you or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
So what huge or <unk> Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel in Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
This is the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who tried to how the <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes out of <unk> or want what you have to take from your self and <unk> what you ever <unk> and he is under the floor -- it takes your name, it takes your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> everyone as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is the <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always favorite <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of rat <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius <unk>
Oh, <unk> <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once you walk in, <unk> <unk> to all with their solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't like to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the very few times as we see <unk> was in the story, and I think this is this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's on the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> from the greatness in the other.
We can <unk> with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
It's only <unk> fiction, jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, east Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11, and landed on the <unk> Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the dark surface gray was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest private program in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
<unk> gave work for about 400,000 people and asked 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the <unk> of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of the surface, which <unk> after death death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't actually brought a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why did <unk> The <unk> answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some wonder, why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why will the mountain scale <unk>
35 years ago, why fly about <unk>
Why do you play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they are simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> was not just a victory of the West over the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and all of the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle, but in 1969, the crew crew 10 miles flew at 40,000 miles <unk>
From 1970, no human being has returned to the moon.
No one has travel faster than the crew from the <unk> <unk> and the joyful luck about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagined how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but it was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that <unk> occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard that for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like whether the technologists would have found themselves and spread <unk> with classified toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> our lives.
But don't deal with the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have created a less ambitious business companies that are <unk> by Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the <unk> investment caused by the creation of <unk> ideas for <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred smaller investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with profit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and that development is also not invested in developing technologies to solve big problems because they don't have a immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't fix the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> less than 2 percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties development the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems they looked like technological, They are not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure on the <unk> of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and deal with food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon declared the war to the cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some extremely resistant types of cancer, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have been found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, and the institutions must support the <unk> must really be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, does it serve with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no political as John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular science of science fiction as we explore the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future are going to be harder to get.
God knows that we are not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to do you with the <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline in trust, is a very widespread statement.
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the target and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> one goal, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, the <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that it may have dropped in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have that.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion surveys over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable 20 years ago are still quite <unk> nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway along the way.
But this is what is enough?
What <unk> opinion is, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at is the <unk> attitudes that people believe when they were doing certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
Probably <unk> by asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other <unk>
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust myself in a certain elementary teacher I know to give the kind of reading class, but somehow to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to <unk> the good judgment for the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I <unk> to have more confidence in terms of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very rightly called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it says, yes, OK, so that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worth trust.
But if, in the other hand, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I would get your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we have tried to build credit accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes more time to do the <unk> that will be <unk> in <unk>
And we found the same problem in our entire public life, and we will argue that the credit accountability system is destined to ensure the <unk> and testing tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
You should have all of you know some of you know.
<unk> all of that, for the target.
I think the goal is that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different from being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we're trustworthy and if you stop determining whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should be <unk>
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, ultimately, it's a signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to make evidence evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That gets a daily day, everywhere, the ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple example of commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks to <unk> says I can <unk> it without giving <unk>
I take them and get it back into the money, or they get them to change the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're really pointing out is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worth trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more and more and more than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started imagining what it would be.
I first created this tool that <unk> in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the <unk> screen is the <unk> <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool to break up the barriers.
But both hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the divide of Science <unk> of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard on a digital area.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with chambers of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the <unk> to get into the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and look at lines, or the words with the virtual touch sensor, that there are down every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and <unk> things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical us so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would that be like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> 60.
This imam <unk> is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
We <unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And when you programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and <unk> and stay in the physical world.
You can be taught physically <unk> and along and the famous shot of Michael Jordan you can reproduce it as a physics reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike monitors or <unk> books, this is a real experience and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us to have to <unk> from our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we shine that barrier, the only limit that stays our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only one <unk> path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if the work would like me or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to an opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
I think that for the rest of my life a second of the two class happiness would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's give books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but it's weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this trap <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet the meeting with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
A lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map struck me out of place, because this is what students should learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in real life?
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
To the Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> in translation, I found that you can win a lot of her.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that Chinese <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back and feel like <unk>
Having a dream <unk> really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, I'm here, happy, living with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on my office in my office, he took off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class <unk> had a <unk> as the first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to just move the head while it was making the solution.
<unk> are the <unk> I said Alex, and so I saw she was right.
You start to work later on, she has children afterwards, to death after the death later.
<unk> like Alex and I had time to have a lot of time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> to press Alex to talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming up with guys under your category, he <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No no, but maybe he <unk> next to the other.
Also, the best time to work on marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in it.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one is going to age in the age of <unk> before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away your dream a <unk> I want to see. It's good. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years.
That means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give your life a lot of people have gone to when they have 30 and <unk>
People in the '40s, I don't panic.
This audience will be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money they <unk>
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming up with their partner <unk>
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it will be <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life and we know that female fertility gets to its top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> over your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended <unk>
The journalists were <unk> names to the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it was absolutely nothing.
And then every day, talented people like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not just <unk>
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the play game.
All running and <unk> but then somewhere around the 30, the music turned the music and everyone started sitting at sitting.
I didn't want to be the only thing I would stay standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds quite a little bit end, but not the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and a career, to choose a city, to choose a city, to choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is so much more difficult and stressful to do all of the <unk>
The middle-aged age crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It is to realize you can't have the race you want now.
You see, you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about your <unk> "What was he doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the mammals are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that I'd like to work in art or the entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They are often done in our sessions, but then they wake up, they don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and <unk> for almost the hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many different contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that's still after the words of emergency case -- please call <unk> <unk>
He was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of me if I give you <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and I didn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that he really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like just sitting while the <unk> of Emma was going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> from that crisis of identity and <unk> of identity.
Because of identity capital -- I mean doing something to add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to go.
I'm not <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that we should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I <unk> jobs and I would tell them.
Secondly, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the minds of the similar minds are limited to who they know -- how they think about it, how they speak, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who gets out almost always comes from outside their closest circle.
The new things come from what are called weak <unk> friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no -- and the weak links are the way that we would engage this group.
Half of the work that we have never been <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job at all.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family, when you have a couple and a <unk>
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit down, that the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook, you start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want to do instead of just making it work or kill time with whoever <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found out the room of a former cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak <unk> helped him get a job there.
That job of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, that I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married with a man who chose consciously <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves his new family, and I send a letter to send me a letter saying, "Now the spaces of contacts are not sufficiently <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at age or 25, even a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> that they know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> his <unk> get capital of identity, using their weak ties pick your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to <unk> students in New York City.
And as any professor, <unk> tests and tests.
I gave you assignments.
When I went on, I went to <unk> grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my students' <unk>
Some of those who had a better performance had no scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know is how to measure it better.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> and in every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk> West <unk>
So we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going on as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in really hard neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private <unk> what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, we came up with a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physics and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach goals in very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future happen.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my questionnaires and then I waited for over a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination were significantly greater than graduation, even when they <unk> them in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing <unk> even the security they felt when they were in school.
So not only is in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> in which <unk> <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, the fact that we know the science of the development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a strong job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the genetic determination is not related to whether or is even related to the talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to get them to start everything else with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, shape and shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was excited about this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning and quickly learning it could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the traces of every character in every character in the right picture.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read from traffic traffic signals from <unk> to understand the basic idea of the pages or the paper.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was shouting <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> from the form of the call, but I like to believe it is the other way. The one that will work.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West.
I call radical these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot of characters.
A person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a viral tree, it's pretty idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three fireworks together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, <unk> are <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each small effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the land of the <unk> sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> the Chinese enemy will be beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a date.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind us that I should stop talking and down stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and lead a magic wand
But when you see that movie, so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of child <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took the rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl who was dressed as a <unk> <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There is a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies generated by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had been <unk>  So I was <unk> in the room and he was impressed as a leg of her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> <unk>
I should feel that it is one of the feeling that Luke give you a military for overthrowing government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do it make Dorothy the film?
They're doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to you to grow up, and not a world of men who <unk> that is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital that <unk> in the movies for our children, and so little out of the road <unk>
There is a lot of literature about the impact of male violence with male violence in the girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that the princess <unk> does not give you the proper framework that was <unk> to navigate the world of adults that is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really hoped that the credits of the <unk> are the end of the movie, right?
My quest has finished, I have an <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> are focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be an <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Disney princess before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though boys, are not really their target to be <unk>
They do a phenomenal job at teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, and lovely and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being <unk>
Of course, the most successful subject of all times continues to appear on classic <unk> classic <unk> each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and son, or two men who raised a girl.
So as many of you are thinking, this year finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when he came back.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the movie, there are more than a female character who has <unk>
So, you have to make the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than you like <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a sense of consensus of what a Hollywood movie is.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the world's crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of 100 <unk> movies how many people think they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then is fine.
But there's a larger number than this one that is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
One in the United States, one in five women said it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> and then you charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power to keep their power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role that it looks after the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star <unk> character you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories that I will tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle only and more stories where he looked like his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and become better people, like the <unk> magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for cookies from the sea on the coast of Maine because my parents told me that I'd give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led to us to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, just seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape made by the building materials and the <unk> activities.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the <unk> Empire at about 4,000 years.
The place is in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that are <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous continuous <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> for <unk> miles.
Before, Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered in the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find out at random to be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we used NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where it was <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated in the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of the sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> we have a number of different years to date from the <unk> <unk> exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> jobs and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the <unk> <unk> these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of <unk> which goes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the <unk> <unk> probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as it looks, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do ideas really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that you're made.
Now you have a bunch of <unk> obese <unk>
They're competing in a <unk> race race and you go into your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide up against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that go on its side, the lightning of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- <unk> the door of the gate,
The <unk> into the hallway or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that's talking about.
You can feel your blue fur, putting on your nose.
They can smell the cookie of <unk> and you can see that it's about to get in the mouth.
<unk> on the side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little laundry dancing over its <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now you go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a path of yellow <unk> and from the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping into you.
All right. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist journalist, I guess, this would be like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different men and a lot of different hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers of <unk> look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minute.
<unk> to see who he could memorize faster than a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition says they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old <unk> invented a half thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the <unk> <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How do you have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English and brilliant English and said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to show up Britney <unk> how to memorize the order of a deck of cards in live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
It ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> In he's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the <unk> Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, I read a number of treaties over the memory that does something over 2,000 years ago in <unk> in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not one thing as rare as it might like this today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they've changed us as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this unique <unk> competition.
It's actually not so <unk> there's a <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College came from London invited a research champion to the lab.
They wanted to know: It will be that they have brains in such a structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you even smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and a really meaningful difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as it <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow. They found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is managing as an armed race where each year is coming up with somebody with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk> memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques in the end of the end of the end of the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox as the <unk> paradox. It says this: I say to two people who remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what <unk>
The person who was told by his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the Baker, Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
And with all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They're using white <unk>
They have <unk>
<unk> good when they come back home home.
You probably know some <unk>
And when we did that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is two and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who was <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, he didn't write to a <unk> he was <unk> to a poet.
He stood up and he <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon she was like, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I was standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where they had been sitting in front of it.
I took the relatives of the <unk> hand, where their loved ones were in between rubble.
What they <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or <unk> or instructions for our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial spatial
If you were telling me that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet if you were telling them to say who I was sitting on the brown speaker in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the <unk> memory is to create this building with your eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy thing, the crazy thing you want to remember -- the <unk> and <unk> it is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to make it from memory, the same way he would have made it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of <unk> <unk> crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that remind you that they want Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote -- that you want to tell.
And then they would go in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help remember it.
So it's like the speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word by word, that is going to confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea to write something long about this <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
Really, it is like seeing a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old hospital <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a lot of fun.
I would never expect it to go.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's really about doing is to improve increasingly the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some security mask covered with tape <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, I had the idea that you could go in, in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> which I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but it's actually not the point.
These are just just tricks. <unk> that work.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to start building <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk> to benefit from <unk> to profit from how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even abstract.
They work because they make us <unk>
It <unk> a kind of deep processing species that most of it is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, it's what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what we're already our short <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to being human being in front of us, who is walking around us being so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory abilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover it in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we just <unk> just a <unk> <unk> Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am of <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a town called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom. I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my <unk> and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there was all the time when I was watching the television, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, all of me, and every time I came up to him, and I got wrapped up in a <unk> and I was wrapped up in a <unk>
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and he hated it.
I took that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those <unk> emotional connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to the Climate Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under a roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice them.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about as well as based on a building built two and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, solid versus the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library. That was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing, <unk> red brick -- which is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the property, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, the another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and sharing.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
<unk> we gave them and we gave them so much, that we get away from the people.
All of the black, we have <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back to those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> And so we started to experience <unk> we make it swing the pendulum back to go ahead and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I took away from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk> on scale.
Really something really hard.
So we're approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
It <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we become <unk> which can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> they won at audacity and <unk>
<unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the business centers and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian.
Maybe with endless sticks of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
We architects feel frustrated and start making the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We <unk> the symbols of the <unk> now we have new design techniques for a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when I was critical and general public and general public, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> <unk>
The tourism tourism went up in a half percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, <unk> New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Frank was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media would spread around them and quickly learned that these shapes and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new millennials happened with other <unk>
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through the whole architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of the information consumption.
Think think, for example, how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
The <unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical places.
The architecture is everywhere right now that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look a long way to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew whether the fact that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> <unk> for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to happen again. <unk> because we're on the threshold of the greatest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and they are actually <unk> in fact, the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished the building, it was part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly to the product -- it didn't look exactly the product, it was not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need to have the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to look for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> who can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there are no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives us the freedom of experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and drawings -- and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, from a movement to the other, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick of red brick based on ideas that it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we're finally going to be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve for sports or to <unk> or even one can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream <unk> on the East East <unk> of New York, and raise half a million dollars from the <unk> community around that cause, it's no one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, and what matters is what we build.
We architects know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give way to the most <unk> spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that very typical way, typical of the kids in a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do it. And when did I do this?
How is that suddenly we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people look at Google "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, you just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells her all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And among what his mom tells her and what his friends, or classmates are saying, doesn't know who believe.
So a video of it itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and asking others to leave a <unk> "I am a nice, "I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> he doesn't even deserve the worth of thinking about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, that gets these answers on one of the stages of their most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going on to do this?
Well, adolescents today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to you, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never ends.
We have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so very young people.
As a mother said, "It's like you have a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, which is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of things that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between living and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what's <unk>
What is most prominent in the life of someone in front of what's normal in a <unk> context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young young people.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> <unk> stars and the singers who are <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities and their studies and other things begin to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see cold enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and how to <unk> society and developing labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the class of the classroom, they will participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call attention by their physical side.
One of each five are not attending class at all day during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the <unk> season -- if you don't think you look at good enough, if you don't believe that you're sufficiently thin, you get a smaller note on the average of your fellow who don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be clear, we are talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance of the body.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem makes less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diets they can take them into a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we thought this is all about what they make more <unk> decisions like consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, relations in the early ages and without protection and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe you are overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they can see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, don't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only to have a good impact but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key <unk> the first is the influence of family and friends and relationships.
These six things are critical points for anyone willing to provide an education in self-esteem than it works.
An education is <unk> but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
I defy the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not because they see them.
We can all begin to do this by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you. When was the last time I was going to get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow valuing their entire person, valuing their individuality, or <unk>
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
So to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because only we'll create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see is never the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
It <unk>
It <unk>
It <unk>
Her <unk> <unk>
It could be just the woman who is on two seats distance. What would it mean for her if they were released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was <unk> he would not have long legs -- <unk> more skinny, more <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we were going to take this out of this, and we would say it would cause your potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are holding us all.
But let's give our children the truth.
It <unk> the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They <unk> the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's switch each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare other people.
And working together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> of a year of age today, will become safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On five of November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> went into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense.
In <unk> initially was it naive, but being prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, began to plan attacks on a dozen New York <unk> including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans was <unk> by an FBI informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't be <unk>
Later on, they would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving mom, who was a <unk> junior elementary school, two people who had to give me happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims, even most Muslims, they get to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't require a lot to make the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think we need to use every single media to do so that everyone lived as them.
A few months before <unk> he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends he and he explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, they had been going to run on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing that our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot I gave him a little orange light on the target and surprise all of me, especially of me, the whole goal on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of all, the comment had been a lot of laughter. But only a few years later, I understood what that funny.
Did you see the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone in the time of packing and going to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was a <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the white but going to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was spending him in house reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to say <unk> <unk> <unk> not prepared for the real world.
I was familiar to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I put to test my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program I participated in the <unk> National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile <unk> as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who we had ever accomplished was Jewish people.
It took several days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all of life had been made to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I met people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
So I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat <unk> <unk> exactly the way I wish I would be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
All night Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helping me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that he conserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of the eyes of someone who has suffered enough <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative negative negative you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put myself in a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is going to try to lead the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which even though I was struck by this violent and violent ideology that I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and loved ones, and for their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism talking to those acts of meaningless acts as rejection to my father's actions.
With this simplicity that I put here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that we project to your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed upon your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human.
Each of us are conscious.
We all have a kind of internal <unk> you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know that I have an consciousness of our own.
I don't know that you are aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we receive to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
<unk> for nature, is an objective of it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the 20th century, we would take that vision.
psychology was studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few medical jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations between some brain areas and some states of consciousness.
So we saw some of this kind of thing in the fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No <unk> to <unk>
There is actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find the explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how to adapt and adapt to living organisms -- all of these questions about the target works.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon -- how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that all of the behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we will focus on this point.
We have a string of wonderful explanations, and we have a little bit of wonderful explanations, the physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains biology, explains some of the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't fit into this <unk>
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
So we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't really know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that we need to <unk> <unk> before dealing with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the <unk> functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is studies all that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to do.
But I go in a different direction.
So in the time that you get -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
We had fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
On the contrary, they are considered fundamental and the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, <unk> <unk> laws -- so I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find out of consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, <unk> then a matter of logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden is not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness, with other core concepts core space, the time, the mass of physical processes -- physical.
<unk> sometimes say we want fundamental laws that we can <unk> them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, of flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that the photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have any kind of crude feeling -- <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do anyone think something so crazy?
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, it's natural to suppose that it can also be universal, like the others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the other different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, simple consciousness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information that's integrated into a system.
And you know, <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration, it is pretty significant to sense of consciousness that really important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there is still a different awareness level of <unk>
It actually proposes a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using lots of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality behind the reality underlying it.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, where does the fire come from?
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be allowed to be able to be used to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically, describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that you put fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that was <unk> then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that thinking about it well, this tends to transform your dreams, whereas what matters in ethical terms and <unk> is not so much the fact that consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right -- these are really serious ethical problems about the development of development systems of intelligent computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the personal collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, a group integrated like the audience at a TED Talk, at this moment we have a collective consciousness, an internal film for this full group of TED, different from the internal movies of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure than the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is that the second thing to be universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal, very normal profile.
I went to school, I fell up with my friends, I was holding my little sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents, because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a evident.
She didn't really get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After my school, I had a under profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be used as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school in <unk> just after 20 minutes in the class of <unk> and a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
And I said, "What a <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about things in school?"
<unk> in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had the experiences with disability with disability as <unk>
And we don't. And it's not blame by the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they are lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something that disability is a <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong with a disability and live with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and you can't make it <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without your hands without a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a little boy running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> inspiration.
And I use the term porn term -- because they <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, because of how bad my life, could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been tackled by strange <unk> to express that they think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was standing in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, <unk> people with disability to profit from people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
<unk> some things.
But the things we <unk> are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we're more likely because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "My God, <unk> are not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all.
However, not <unk> that I'm so fortunate that I do.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that you fall off --  -- you know, the ingenious trick of how to upload your mobile phone on your cell phone battery.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a stretch stretch has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen won't make the <unk> <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> to get out of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of people's people, and I want to live in a world where a kid at the 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you believe.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of <unk> they think in "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality reality will change our lives both as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the <unk> <unk> the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 <unk> trying to <unk> it with all of its self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So I took some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the hull, you give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> <unk> is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
So a moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but there's nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, it will be their favorite players -- and you have asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
I was a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why this video video.
Man: Oh, good.
No, no, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when I was a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and do a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball down to the <unk> or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it was <unk> for <unk> for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win.
So here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to her <unk> <unk> in the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player going back to your group and you see their next run shown in front of you, in a plastic display that you wear in front of you, you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
<unk> the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, you lose games, and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties to you like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game <unk>
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys are going to have information <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being only for <unk>
It will also be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
It <unk> the ball.
<unk> to an open <unk> Suddenly, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> usually not <unk> but the <unk> system is <unk>
<unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's an open <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees the <unk> a area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The good audience and the fans have been on the pass on each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
So I'm going to do lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what is literally going to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how ecologically their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more about space and science instead <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, <unk> reality comes close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face -- <unk> as the always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the southern end of the Lofa County, which includes the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, to be one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> who Joseph <unk> chief engineer, building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide since the bridge is not <unk> nor <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such that the each of them frees up from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used for <unk>
After a fall of four to five seconds, your body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them dies of impact.
The ones that don't normally be <unk> in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this method of suicide will realize <unk> death to the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel in the bridge.
This is where most people have been to before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is at that edge, and at the darker time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had to succeed that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
So we had <unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but to the officials as well.
We've come a long way ever since.
Today, veterans officials are training to the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the past 22 <unk> last year when they got a call from a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, he looked at Jason talking to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Jason was just 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She was <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and left.
This kind and clever guy from New Jersey who had just taken out of her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason parents at night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
The damage damage from suicide affect lots of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it out to suicide <unk>
What do you say?
<unk> what does that?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how you feel, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that they need.
If you think somebody's <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask them is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and will be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the October of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go down the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> of 49 percent of the <unk>
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and they reported that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who could be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before wrong without having a real <unk> disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and tour the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th, of 2005, I wrote a radio call for a possible suicide bomber on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I <unk> my bike, and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day will come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What did he did <unk> and <unk> the hope and the other <unk> life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
He stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness which has been properly <unk>
<unk> by Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God by you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of the end, she wrote, <unk> When I went to the General San Francisco General at the night, you were <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and <unk>
It speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
suicide is not just something I found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, <unk> the opportunity to meet him.
This is what the suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, you wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want your own <unk>
Usually this is achieved just three things: to sleep, or the drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls around the bridge.
In those incidents that I've been directly involved with -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I was <unk> by hand.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people who have jumped from the bridge, and they can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second thing they leave on the side, the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be trying to do.
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but your inside you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you do?"
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone alone at all.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally managed to sleep that I had ever been from a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I am going to go later on, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just starting.
We are all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of the skin or by the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my neighbors -- my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is my own.
He recorded me as a <unk> at birth because of my genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my home, I was always wearing this t-shirt <unk>
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never forced me to share my story, not because I think being a bad thing, but how the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as I was <unk> this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He said to me that if she was responsible for the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> And that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and I was a third <unk> among more than 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he <unk> remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that she passed my request for the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know what if you beat the United States, you can change your name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was going to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to perform the most sophisticated surgeries and safe surgery.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to get surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, the name of the <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity identity means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And a young woman in New York who <unk> was living his truth, but he <unk> <unk> his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we do a global <unk> for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living in my truth, and only for me.
I want to do the best to help the other live truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for that one day there is no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, thank you for all my <unk>
For my network of support, my parents especially, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> I had <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't take the phone, he would take my mom and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's just identity identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that assignment, no block, and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, parents often have been known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the <unk> National <unk> became very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and to exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when I was born, a girl, their birth will not fall down.
It's not welcome or his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood goes, <unk> to the mother, and nobody would get a parent.
And a mother was <unk> a lot for having a child.
When it comes to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when she <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the <unk> mother but the daughter. The <unk> daughter is <unk>
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and the school dies on his brothers.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it goes into 13 years, he fights to go out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of course honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption code doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the <unk>
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> very humble and <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and he accepts the decisions of their father and her mother and the decisions of the patients, even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then give birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson to her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so before I was <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she carried it up, when she was four and a half years old, I got it in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in many developed countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that he has entered the world of dreams and aspirations that can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of a <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
And I was going to sit down with me when my friends came to see me.
The <unk> to go with me to a different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> it in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've been <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls, <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and got up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, the BBC, was offered her for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and October October 2012, 2012, he was shot in <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, she would tell me the ear of my wife and "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, your <unk>
And he said, "Please don't get <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of truth by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words would be very much for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve, was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by my wife's face.
But my daughter will never <unk>
I used to say, "I am well with my <unk> smile, and with my face.
I'm going to do well. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights, and of women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when he didn't run his job.
They fight with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before joining Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
Are you being just as smart or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I wouldn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and trying to engage them to keep in life.
More than once I saved me for a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would <unk> to try to get the <unk> <unk> because there is really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started testing with <unk> and I was struck by looking at how small changes in the doses are dramatically -- my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a <unk> and typical chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised to see how I <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various types like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out like an end.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't deal with it.
My <unk> changed.
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to <unk> since then I am better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think about almost a pictures, and that became my key reference point -- how to do those mental images that I use to create my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I wanted to find the point right now, and I have lots of great <unk> mental <unk> really very sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to make these mental images, of my mind to the screen screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of cinema was able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image by representing the brain, here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their <unk>
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain from one person looking at an image.
The column of the medium shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were <unk> to see that same image.
The column on the right was <unk> the contents of the central column on the left of the left.
This <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into the visual waves in <unk>
Let's take it this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of feedback from the brain to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images new animals, new animals, and as long as they <unk> a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain brain information to scan it to show what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us.
We're pretty well about doing that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you create the same <unk>
This led to the brain scan systems that are available today, and its resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look at a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are many techniques to do that.
One is open up the skull and it will introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new <unk> techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets, but at this point, <unk> magnets only offer little improvements in the resolution, not gains for thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea: Instead of more big, let's make better magnets.
Can we create a lot more complex structures with different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI was to make really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in recent <unk> of brilliant brilliant and brilliant and brilliant and brilliant radio <unk> and <unk> radio <unk> in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field -- the <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> to the <unk> radio frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing can actually increase the information that you can extract in one single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the <unk> fluid but the hormones of the hormones and the hormones that I mentioned is that I mentioned and maybe even the <unk> neural activity. This is sleep.
We are going to be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our skills and communication.
Certainly, this very tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have few options that will open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your <unk> may be telling some person for the first time your love, or telling someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation you have to do is that you're getting through life.
I'm all going to be a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that <unk> is a universal thing.
<unk> and we don't like that, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits <unk> the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> as a <unk>
And to be the slope of my pants <unk> and because I was taking my pants down, I would ask myself a little bit, I would usually ask a little kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there was some uncomfortable silence on the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper, the mother tossed a cold and look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> on it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was about to go into full of the women's issues at the table.  He had the dates of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a little breath, and I went down my back, and my back, a <unk> girl with a pink dress with a pink dress with a pink dress and a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took a little breath, again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the kid from a boy, and I saw a girl, and you know, as you like to use a rose and rose and sometimes you like to use a <unk> <unk>
Well, I'm more of the kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some aspects in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a feels living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from yours, or yours or yours.
I would give you a hundred reasons about why to go out of my <unk> it was more difficult than getting out of your own, but this is the <unk> The hard is not <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me that I'll explain to someone who have declared in <unk> <unk> is harder than it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your five year-old son you're going to <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, just the hard thing.
We need to stop <unk> what is hard to do for other people to make us feel better or worse in relation to our possessions, and we should only feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a <unk> not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse, a high dress and <unk> shoes.
He was not a <unk> lesbian prepared to fight every child of four years that would fit into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, I <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> <unk> my gay, gay, and move only a muscle is the closest I ever done.
My family, my whole friends, full strangers I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was <unk>
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been following for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill you.
One of my most memorable bankers was on the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and I was gay, and when I did my <unk> she was gay, and I finally walked around the tables and finally I got to one where my parents were friends who knew I knew it was <unk>
And after talking about a moment, one of the women cried <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV program.
Our favorite <unk> program.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying to show his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had a chance at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
That's how hard conversations remain to be my strong point.
Ask anyone I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay <unk> but understand that what comes out of any <unk> is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> armor. Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe you might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a real hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex things.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be <unk> for that.
And some of them can go out and wounded wounded -- so they have done, but it's never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some will feel <unk> but something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not <unk>
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the <unk> question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the computer army as Alan <unk>
And so some years ago, I <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a walk.
First of all, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a <unk> race that you don't know about the Earth of Earth or the Earth of Earth or the Earth's intelligence of Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the Earth, it will be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain point in time, the asteroids that will be able to <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, which <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, at <unk> planning, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, for a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is an underwater force, which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open options with a force -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yeah, until an impending <unk> future time.
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
<unk> tries to maximize future freedom of action and keeping the choices open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the <unk> level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long run, but actually arise from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long term in any system that will be in the inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal testing, to play human games, and even making the money <unk> actions, all of it without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just as a human standing <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically on a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This skill skill will have applications for humanoid robotics and development technologies and human care.
This ability to use applications will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> your potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where your friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the very connected network.
This same <unk> capacity is also about health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the pathways of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Panama to broaden the global level their reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> array of action action, successfully by assets under their <unk>
This ability to risk will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all the flow of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion as well.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion that we would present in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all right, that the impulse to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask, how do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement is to move to the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoiding the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
But in the last few years, we have <unk> our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the faint <unk> of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they sort of get a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data gathered in Kepler show the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their <unk>
Instead, this gives it clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014, it was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a weather and the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the planet -- more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the first planet, and the planets we know better than our solar system.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part of it that we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking its surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission is taking samples from the atmosphere and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offered not just short space flights but also the <unk> of living on Mars.
But despite all these images that remind us to the deserts of our planet, you remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in charge of places really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on Earth, the air is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement from the colonization of Mars and other planets would drag up with a great and sad <unk> and the implication of some that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> the Earth.
So as long as I like exploration exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will comment on the <unk> party --   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration and the Earth's preservation will not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
It's only more about home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> in the hostile and <unk> spaces of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an experiment. The paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi <unk> asked to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to be able to pursue the stars between the stars, losing the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are developing this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> <unk> and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to address the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quick I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and all were closed closed.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early in Europe to the next morning, and I took my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but surely they don't even more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, even though the circumstances were really stuck.
I'm a <unk> a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rate -- and the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something I could do, systems that would be able to put in its place, which would <unk> that were bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who's the winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to prevent the things that were going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, they <unk> a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the words are, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that they move very much.
This is the reason for losing keys on your car, <unk> <unk>
So at home, they would take a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For her <unk> a particular <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you make a place and they are <unk> it will always be there when you <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards, a license, <unk> <unk> by mail to the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So some of the hands-on practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the way to help them make a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular doctor.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for social decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we need to take from the fact that a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have already heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even you're likely to know people that <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask for the most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not blame for the doctor, and if it's somebody's <unk> it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> -- what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
So this is according to the research of researchers cynics -- <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I was exploring the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance for 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and is, <unk> out of the <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, well, five percent is not likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you do this with time, so you don't have to make the effects of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of <unk> by the drug that helps you the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical ethic is <unk> it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that gets more done in the older men of 50, prostate <unk> the number you will try to treat is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent the effects just <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make it <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice, many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that I could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things you talk about and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can change opinion at the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face your face with a predator with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or <unk> or immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. They could get lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown here.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail every single time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be able to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I <unk> at night in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the door of input in the same case, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I have not <unk> and lots of text messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite piece.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> it can be -- never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language came over the <unk> and over the time step of time, he mixed with local <unk> and developed the language we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, it's really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a <unk> world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following the <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
They <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
I've learned, for example ...
<unk> <unk>
"Don't make a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they didn't <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to go.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, making it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that was called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything they had taught me in sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could <unk>
I chose to get <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it doesn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in school, I work with the institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, at asking <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you won't continue this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic <unk> <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and fully expressing the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect everything as much of the signals as well as the sounds of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a <unk> metaphor to understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as your facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the body, the way it hits the piano, English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just a <unk>
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a <unk> idea of <unk>
If only a button would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of <unk> and volume.
In <unk> using these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and I put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun and he is wearing.
This is what day."
If you look at it, and you measure the speed, the visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to me as <unk>
"All fear?
This is all night, on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  I will reject it."
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time expressed time in <unk> and how distance you can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes more close and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk> at the same time."
Watch <unk> hand hand, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do that with me?
All of the hands itself.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as well as the chest, sort of like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And again, again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest. But they transmit very different differently.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and <unk> as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't automatically have any social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to grow its own value without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to <unk> You don't have to hear the music.
The <unk> is a wealthy trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and to experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "Can you get them out, but then you have to <unk>
It involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up on an innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrific truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning the others.
The time, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait very much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of waste.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive, and it's going to use those enormous <unk>
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years old, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids that manipulate power tools are great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we bring it down to the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> it into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using one robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children would be <unk> with the robots.
Then we set up quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turn light bulbs and web cameras and <unk> it in a floating robot that is slowly moving through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor, while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of how many plastic in the water.
<unk> this thing happened to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would do it even further.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're <unk> they're trying to fix it.
I wanted to research my problem with myself, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get to be <unk> with this image.
A kid, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that you drink -- it's the water in which the water <unk> the water where you live.
You can also see the water is brown, the mud and the oil are also brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of features that produce different <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send him to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to research a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half a Japanese and French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we started a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, nuclear power in the water.
And today, according to the reports -- an average of 300 tons are still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific has traces out of traces for <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure ultraviolet radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has safe aspect of it is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I have come back to <unk> every year from the crash and independently independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we reported to the <unk> center here, you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of their life.
Along with them, we discuss the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced <unk> data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition the nearest power plant to date.
We are approaching up to a mile of the nuclear power -- and with the fishing aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea with a plate of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, too, with very simple open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try and invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became so much small so that we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and turning it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood metal metal, a little bit of biology, basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where kids can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asking things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or well, we can help in the mobility of the elderly population transforming their standard <unk> in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation so that they worry about the environment and the people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite culture.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One is <unk> over the environment, the other thing believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one is designed by it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made out of <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> parts of <unk> with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are cooler with small <unk>
One acts mostly like filter and <unk> and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that changes gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work in between the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between assembly and <unk> between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, and synthesis, is shown on two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why was it not possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where we were <unk> four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools across scales, large-scale feet like this robotic arm with a <unk> basis, with a <unk> basis, that some day not very distant to print <unk> and graphs made of genetically engineered <unk> that they shine in the dark.
Here we <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is the only size to shape the shape of light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the ability to create a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion fashion fashion in Paris with <unk> they are <unk> it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This <unk> combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical and <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair at the same and comfortable chair, and also <unk> sound.
The <unk> Professor <unk> came back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> <unk> it becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but they continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts of nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and got to define a lot of what I care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
That first <unk> tree would not have any difference between trunk, <unk> sheets and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow with <unk> cortex, soil and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What's the design if the objects were made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons produced every year by organisms as <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate structures that could be produced in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We were asking a lot of <unk> shrimp, the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to get a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the robot could vary the properties of the material on the march, and to create these structures made of one material <unk> long, 100 percent recyclable percent.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it to dry it to find a natural form to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with a plastic <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which first showed up for the first time on the planet <unk> billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of beam to mesh, and if it broadens even the window.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant <unk> and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for the objects that are designed for <unk> <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration of the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the ability to create clothes to keep the life for <unk> <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control its flow.
So as the Blank <unk> did our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid alchemy only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that inhabit in the human teeth.
One turns light into sugar, the other <unk> sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the tract tract <unk> that will help us <unk> these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels and more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when they stretch from one end to the other is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk> matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the harmed tissue, and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer can print <unk>
It also knows that nature does not do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture a home in which it was <unk>
<unk> not <unk> at this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers to each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm -- to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with solid sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
However, when we put the silk worm on a flat <unk> not inside a box, we realized that you would take a cocoon <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly by the environment.
<unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the <unk> <unk> without boiling a <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going into the darkest areas and so that's why we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, <unk> the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We asked <unk> silk silk to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to get away with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By the <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, you have <unk> silk worms -- <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk by a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology of two materials, designers have to bring these two visions of the world.
What drives us back around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired by nature to a inspired nature of us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever wondered what do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused you some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, <unk> and art and <unk> websites -- I played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it off.
But then I was struck by something else, something completely different, and I got stuck in it, and I just let me absorb and I feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you asked for me then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> it learned about culture.
So we ask the first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would <unk> at that age.
It's considered a naive question to provoke simple responses to children like, <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow up in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to be asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before you remove the dream.
Why?
If this question helps kids to dream about what they might be, doesn't inspire to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe they are <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> and a teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choice.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real calling, the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you are somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that bring your curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, as <unk> <unk>
During the timing of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of approaching a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
There are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests in cartography, visualization for data visualization and <unk> and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation occurs at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower <unk> is fast learning.
When we <unk> it into something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all that we've learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and a <unk>
As a girl, <unk> an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their practices and this ability to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to do what you would tell you, even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, and a web book designer -- sometimes fifty of a <unk> sometimes <unk> and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does good work.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles as it can take out of your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to match the market needs, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, how quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
They <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams were made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that are connected to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part will give them to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there is one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who have been aware of being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity on those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> was brought it into a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until it was passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> he made a <unk> and they found strange plates in the brain of <unk> of a guy who never had seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you could have been alive today, we could not give her to her more help than he was <unk> he gave her years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, <unk> to HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been made in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million across the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that by the way, will include many of you.
If you wait for 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the chance that they spend their years to be paid with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or being beloved disease.
In America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care will spend in disease disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs of five times in the year 2050, which is 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot cure or cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on research on the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer cancer than Alzheimer's despite the fact that we can afford more Alzheimer's and cause a number of similar numbers of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitability part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain, in comparison with a patient's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleashed a severe memory of memory and mental skills, damage to Alzheimer's brain significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places on paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other who can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what happened is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You know, a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that we can do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in the most part, the wires have been reduced and waited the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened when they test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other into each other, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a good initial result: but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of waiting for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince you that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on government, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We now see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the <unk> <unk> caregivers of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> by them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
This article in the column in the column -- New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, you do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it as a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers <unk> to do 36 more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or ability, what would that be?
Number five: When was the last time you would go to somebody else?
And <unk>
To <unk> these are becoming more personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me Tell your partner what you like to him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really thing really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we got <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column -- Love to a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably wondering: They follow together <unk>
And the reason I think you ask this is because I have done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can come to some hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and I thought that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as they gave it, I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and then Saturday, this happened on my blog <unk>
And the Sunday, I have been called the <unk> Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing <unk> about own experiences -- but another thing is discovering that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick quest for my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages came out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers were <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when they test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and he refused to pictures of them two.
I think I was afraid I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> process, a range that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study works, they wanted to know if it was actually able to produce love, not just a adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt, especially that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if they were <unk> or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 <unk> <unk>
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first on these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not making romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for interpersonal encouraging interpersonal students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants had felt closer to the participants and several studies -- we also used <unk> protocol <unk> <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction <unk>
They've used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people in opposite political <unk>
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this piece, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you love the person who you do it?
Well, he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> they did better know better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I encountered the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to practically all my adult life, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I focus on science.
And I did all of what I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of sort of sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just went through the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was built with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to me then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably more than reasonably <unk>
What I'm looking for is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told you about the 36 questions is that there may be a short <unk>
There may be a way for some ways to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that asks, still follow together?

So more than a question, I would submit to ask questions more difficult questions, like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a <unk> or even more, how you live with the doubt of your mate?
I don't necessarily necessarily ask these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation, what does it mean to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year ago, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> in <unk> because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was not considered everything that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't consider how many times we would have that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always choice or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and respond 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and to have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think of true.
And what I <unk> and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope he will also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian <unk> and in a certain way, I got like a <unk> of the forest.
 New York City makes a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you put a dollar bill -- a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of these strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's happy because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, I covered the covered and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more <unk> on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it in some way it looked like it increased size, as if it was to <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, and we would have strange bottles that I was finding out of the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw out of space.
I can flow <unk> to draw like a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, let me tell you that you can have an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started riding exhibits and those things, and I was making some money out of money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form of human form, and sculptures of human <unk> with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because it was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing of a window, and then in another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional <unk>
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 thousand pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's twice a face, so it's 10 meters of <unk>
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are headed by the <unk> lists to commit suicide in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god of God tied into a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand, and it spits out the clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological self that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of storytelling.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a meter of <unk> feet of a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Its tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my final project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material being <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 thousand pounds of being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest, you can get the entrance to him.
I'm going to fill you around the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick primer on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This is two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue in the head.
There's a little forest of forest within the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a writer, a <unk> a museum -- a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the boundaries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very handmade.
And if we don't start to swap those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug drug <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in your blood, and increase the count of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects of <unk> in its most negative, because at the time that it takes in getting to the skin, it gets <unk> and worse than the time it takes to get to its destiny, which is where most importantly, in the <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily get into the bloodstream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the big issue of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of labor run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you are used in <unk> for wounds and <unk> surgery can be used for anything else, including the <unk> transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser <unk> to open up or drill extremely small holes, that you open and close the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people are asking, "How is that <unk>
So we sent a little <unk> laser on the cellular membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology now, in vitro or tectonic plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How do that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is turning to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that goes out directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher of the <unk> in our case, a <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've looked at armed groups of armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to do better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from participation of violent involvement in confrontation not violent.
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and the non-governmental actors.
For example, in <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we should even be able to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what these organizations motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, how they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies of the policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global picture.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, we have also established a political party -- a social services network and a military <unk>
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide bombers against Israel, also runs the Gaza Bank from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply fire.
<unk>
We <unk> a complex machine communication stations radio stations and radio channels and Internet channels and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the print <unk> magazine in English and published in <unk>
<unk> groups will also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their money to recruit and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties to their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put together professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population offering us something that the state of no security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an <unk> Afghanistan or even the principle of <unk> <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, provide social services that means filling a void, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 for 2006, Palestinian Hamas can't understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid here.
<unk> because they fill gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated times are these organizations, but we can less <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all their <unk> collect the trash and the <unk> system.
It's an state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else and new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and of the nations, and the more weak these are the states, as in the Middle East, more <unk> and they fill that gap out of government actors.
This is important for governments, because to counteract these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
The government <unk> has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and I block peace.
If we can better understand groups, we will understand better what incentives to offer to foster violence is not in violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need investments for the long term to fill that gap of security, to fill that <unk> government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a lawyer, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> tag that would be unfair to the <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews -- people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a big thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and that <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated in all the world and anger, in particular seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and ugly.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asked too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as the free of <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it to use and accessible to contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to keep our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion, and our social condition skills and a lot more.
We need to have the differences of these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I get to work, I hear rap music -- just <unk>
Though the lyrics <unk> to women and offends it, and I offends the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang -- is amazing.
And actually <unk> your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical <unk>
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  -- all the <unk> tasks but also killing insects, the trash collection and <unk> <unk> and maintaining <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of nice <unk>
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, she is his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, <unk> that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in ways that makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the working workers, gay workers and <unk> for white women, <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist thing.
It also takes the following: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it will be <unk>
When we get <unk> I take them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself <unk> that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid to be <unk> as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that <unk> means to be able not to be able to achieve with some realistic expectations.
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it, I call it.
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> in front of the word <unk> from three feet tall.
It was a <unk> view of this pop star to embrace feminism and to know women and to young men that will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics start endless <unk> if it was or not just a feminist.
<unk> its feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go far beyond sane <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, an more inclusive feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions do that make it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very <unk> I want to grow in a world.
They were <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sports, -- <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in their magazine, participating in their project, or to work with you, until they don't have a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also predict it to be even more as well as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without adopting these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the people in the power of <unk> and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim that with courage our <unk> well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, especially because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it a incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after all I didn't tell me to believe that I could really say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I focused on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin <unk>
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and <unk> I also discovered that if it was a little brave, another woman could be <unk> and see me and realize that none of us is the world about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And on the other, I argue the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to get my way to think, what I say and what I do without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that all of us can be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had measles to have visited or visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the things that we think about this outbreak is that the measles that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most powerful diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly even <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and the vaccines that are marked <unk> and marked by being an fraud <unk> by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that have theory that cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard about it they create all his professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence continued steady just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> organizations like <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What is going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers for Disease Disease Center what is going on, they tend to be based on the phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "a better detection detection -- to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> much the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact face.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we came up and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds and private worlds to people around it, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands to their faces, but they were <unk> <unk> like when they didn't put their favorite toy on their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on it, declared that I had seen less than 150,000 true cases of his syndrome as <unk> <unk> of places like South Africa.
This is really not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned down to nine of 10 kids sent to the other doctors in their doctor's office, not to give them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of a child <unk> caused by cold and cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have kept very carefully at a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents -- they were desperate to win their approval with.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist. I thought the theory of the mentor mothers of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was warm and <unk> and they had a daughter autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as no services, no services, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to defend in the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic kids, and their families, <unk> Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
We took a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more and diverse and diverse diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, of dinosaurs or the genealogy of <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have models.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one have <unk> these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the year after the paper <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this piece of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no even a translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was <unk> and he <unk> it for her.
The paper offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the children follow their games, on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disabled disabilities in life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of the entire life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, and I called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included a staggering variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> known in the pop culture like the awkward social scientist <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that will reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide and <unk>
These changes in a <unk> <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world saw an autistic adult for the first time.
So before I grew up <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> performance performance -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition -- <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents from all over the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, these first clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the conscience of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that they were making the autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> and a powerful, powerful, <unk> and credible story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the state of preventing children in the United States are on the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have been linked on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for the new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows -- it doesn't mean it's <unk>
In <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a care deficit to detail.
Indeed, people are struggling to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with skills, supportive communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As they <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
