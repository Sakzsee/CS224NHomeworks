You know what I do is to write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that fell into you.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in Ohio <unk> where I was the rare of the class.
When he was beaten up to bleed every week in the bathroom, and until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I allowed me to get to the bathroom room.
It made it a secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting the AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could put it to Ohio and please bring that man you know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to tell you about please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the take care of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the other.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and <unk> and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around me <unk> of water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a snowflake about another snow <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the ice walls.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold it up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that they're isolated and they were isolated and themselves, as well as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I'm breathing their atmosphere up.
As a <unk> <unk> releases fresh water in minerals that feeds in many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments, there are that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get a <unk> <unk>
Here they go.
You can see the left on a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved over the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an awful <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single baby <unk> OK.
So two couples every single baby.
I don't want you to get too much into the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of it, I'm not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome -- the chromosome is joined by the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X chromosome.
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll talk to them later.
And in my own activity it will come to two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people come up with the anatomy -- that -- of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluid, the idea of the <unk> what has thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins, two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex in individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit in the male and female feminine schemes and female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't fit in the ordinary or male forms or females.
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that becomes <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testes make testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the body.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops following a typically female course.
When you <unk> the baby has a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it is growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the period of menstrual and when someone realizes something is going on.
After you test tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like I -- I consider a <unk> woman, doesn't know its <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a bit complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form that can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and she was wearing a life as a boy and had just discovered that he had 3.5 boy and he had a <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had a <unk> and the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to hormone <unk> typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have the medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> -- they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there's a lot of <unk>
The reason that children with this kind of bodies have come to be <unk> twins, or <unk> they are <unk> surgeries -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you're tested to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy is bringing together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- being black wants to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very divergent ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children who are born like two people inside the same body.
The highest recent case is last year with the South African South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder, "What are they going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists that don't exist as a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more than we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were <unk> categories that are happening directly with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than we <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
In terms of race, something that happens far more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimpanzees.
What about the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved in in science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in our current culture, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
And our ancestors never had to get them into this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you would put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved it still not to do it.
If he stopped moving it <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> to people who are unusual bodies -- but I have to admit that I'm nervous.
And so they would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
So let's go from a concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, which I find every single way to see that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk>
<unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and we would compare it to another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our <unk> <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The Chinese monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had a clear idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was being passed through the heart of the blood left to the father and then the father and so on.
<unk> fathers rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, that was really radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear -- if you look at the story of <unk> <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being transmitted by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Day, they talk about nature and God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were passing the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid out the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women were <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights Movement saying, "I'm a man."
So again, people from color that are <unk> the <unk> coincidence about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish for a human rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we should go back to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five years were supposed to allow for sexual activity, or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary. were born three months before the time: June 1 of 1980.
Henry, in the other hand, was born at term: was born September 1 of 1980.
For the fact that I had been born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before you have Henry -- the right to the sex consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because he was born later.
We found others in relation to their rights.
Henry, what are you in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the reason that Mary doesn't worry about.
Mary. On his hand, you don't have the same rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So it still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science was so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to us.
Where do we go from?
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are caught in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain time has decided to marry a man and you don't have a <unk> and to marry a woman with a woman to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests to people <unk>
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you to the principle of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I love <unk> he offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be involved in this for rights to people -- because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more and more intelligent and <unk> decisions about their sexual relationships than about 40 than I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current kind of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you're willing to have a change of sex, in which case it allows it to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made the light <unk> <unk> and then they were picking up the fame.
But when the phone asked her the <unk> <unk> a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it has considered political asylum.
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to conclude, I mean, I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it could have been, if we had been, if we had a lot of participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in groups.
Since years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about today's studies, is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in <unk> one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought it was <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
Tell me, what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> <unk> so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I think there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brains and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people in the state, it's possible that there would be <unk> more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we look at democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their construction cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just went through the buildings that are going to go through the apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments whether they were owners and the other half is still not to do that.
You could try to increase the capacity to <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, and build a whole apartment building, always again, and when the rules of that place will be able to build it rather than putting it down.
So I proposed that governments were going to have new reform zones in large enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they knew from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> country for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, we would be able to <unk> it into a platform where they would provide reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
They have a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like <unk> of <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a <unk> friend sent him a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
So I tried to explain to you about how valuable cities are far more valuable than their cost to <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> he called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go and talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This is only this airport covers over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, we have to start with a site that <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor "Professor thank you for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city is able to offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might be going to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of kilometers away from the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government, they need help from <unk> countries that could benefit from the countries that would help them establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And so soon on the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow you to create these special special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this voting crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
<unk> in the Constitution, has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed over again in another voting -- of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the <unk> of the 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> shifting <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in building in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's built in North Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, practical this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow managers to <unk> and maybe allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing his Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new criminal system.
There are urban urban planners who are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have figured out is that they have a good number of people.
There are lots of companies who wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free zone zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world, there are 700 million people who say they would like to switch immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to go and get a job, sometimes they have to make money for the money to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you seem to think about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a confession to public -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and post on my blog, colorful and different <unk> for each time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores in hand.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people, usually my money is going to be a good <unk> and my view is <unk> and buying it into my personal quest of <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
I'll like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I have won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what you're going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anyone have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of inner clothes and nothing else.
<unk> inside exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else that I want to use after you get here to <unk>
And because you don't know me how the woman walks for TED in clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call this <unk> tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> and it cost me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost impossible to be out of bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just tell you, you can also get sick.
<unk> <unk> of the boy who are wearing within.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remind you to your <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think that you do well with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't have to look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal question, six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people were approaching this week just by what I was using. And we had fantastic conversations that we were using.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about learning this week is that we have to leave some things back there.
I don't need to be emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side is the intuitive side.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists have a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A intuition that may have developed over the age of years is that it says that one thing can be just in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing on a parking lot.
It was a little boy, and it didn't do it very well, it's always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of the parking lot taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow them to get them and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking lots, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things that are really rare -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need you to describe the big objects that around us every day.
That's not really good at my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it doesn't really be good at my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal and a springboard for springboard and <unk>
And then I did this almost the same way that you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip and I started working all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming swimming form that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird, but then when other people will go up to do those things, because I don't want them to get them -- or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The companions on the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light that goes <unk> and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal that will behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
It <unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then you take it to a temperature of less than one degree at all.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as well.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way it was <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when we give it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't go at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and you don't go back at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillion atoms in atoms that make up that piece of metal is still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in particular <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, this is my part of the logic that I'll talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we put it down, and we lit the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is hearing that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define you who you are, and that's the deep weirdness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so.
And so many negotiations and stories, the <unk> with 17 museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just on this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
It was a big education, not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and went to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you a demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from her launch.
So we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery <unk> the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk>
Actually, I'm going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click around and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
Go forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click out here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million <unk>
It can go in a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this kid, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to have a <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came in, I found that the kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a <unk> pole.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into the depth and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite night <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van <unk> actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and actually <unk> it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really neat part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all of all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, to create their own collection from all these pictures.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just made a <unk>
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what they feel at looking at these masterpieces <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, they even have come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium is to do justice to their work and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a <unk> one pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm basically Italian, all the kids in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something really interesting at the race of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
You know, some time ago, if you wanted to win a race of Formula 1, it took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, the control system of control in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now the interesting thing is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics covered in networks.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms that are going to become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans, we have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end I took the hammer and he threw it down to the <unk> -- you can still see a little bit of <unk> and he said he said, <unk> -- <unk> <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer while in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at the <unk> activity of the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the early afternoon there are people here and there are <unk> <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> time <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, <unk>
That night everyone went to <unk> at the center.
You see the big summit.
The next day, everyone went to the middle of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> <unk> people will <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> are not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the pattern of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed small tags to track the trash in their shift through the system.
We started with volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all over the <unk>
Then we put a little chip, and a label on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we had not disappears, it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the Mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And the curtain was going to open up so that we can go to see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entry of the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and windows -- but when you get this opens up so that you can pass it up.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building, and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter when the roof comes down the roof, and he said, "Let's get the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all of the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> so it happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not match when the sensors open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to leave you to happen, but a building that kept doing <unk> and holes in the water and you had to jump up for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the hardware, the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, to form.
This kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that could be a <unk> cloud of a 3D pixels to which you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns out, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance of <unk> today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use it as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much 3D digitization in real time as it capture.
It can break all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people involved in to do something and change our environment <unk> like a <unk> farm as a breeding farm -- but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go from the digital world, the <unk> power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collective shape.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to serve to share the primary moments of the Beijing Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection with the community.
So this is a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can get in there there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes -- they could improve <unk> by more accurate precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, being stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you most excited about.
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk>
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> probably went to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about the <unk>
Oh, most people, it makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe it is possible?
Evolution has been a theme here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who was in the <unk> Church, he wrote a trial called "Nothing called "Nothing except for the light of the <unk>
But actually actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, what interests us most.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
At the time, there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, or it is the same protein, which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> is raises the <unk> of <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that you can want to want without any effort to do.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush rush to the output.
But by the other thing, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so that I hope you've got it <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to the two daughters of that cell.
But when organisms come from, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body is going into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year that was happening, I was getting more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still lie in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits your door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a magnificent <unk> of clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> it looks for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, George "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different aim to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just a different <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to be healthy.
I wanted to bring health into the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we'll let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us <unk> the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily lead to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily hurt the biggest or the strongest or the faster and even the smartest
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only time of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria -- that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there was fish there, <unk> fish -- however, have been able to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution -- and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning is that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is to create a evolution of traditional natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll up, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when the species -- <unk> planets are going to exist isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- a sexy possibility, intriguing and terrifying possibility of it.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the decisions we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but that's what it is <unk>
Think of it as well as if you could choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to do the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of course, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to the cost of 20,000 and a week.
We don't have a lot to make the human genome to make the human genome and be increasingly increasingly at all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human human in bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect us but they're going to engage against the other virus.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against the flu vaccine of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just other two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and <unk> or change the newborn egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier opportunity to eliminate diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want the more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology is that the same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of <unk> <unk> especially if you could get them to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be compelling.
And when we're in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can rotate it at 1,000 years and maybe it happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful <unk>
Or, let's choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more inclusive, or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before it could make these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane filled with smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one who could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem, we probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot has <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
That's not the road.
Let's take the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three words more <unk> than I heard about.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to make before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to have and I didn't have to <unk>
While I was thinking about that, I got a phrase that is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as the bridge George Washington, which wasn't for a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I would argue with things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental watch is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be breaking up in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, "I would die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point, I understood that by connecting those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not dying that day.
And I gave me another gift that was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that you can imagine it on your airplane -- and please don't be like this, but you can imagine, and how do you think about it.
What are you going to argue that they still do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after he running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the start of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis, today.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation, so, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second isn't that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're important and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Somebody saw the film <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they go marking with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with a single desire to deliver a check, and instead of that sign a check that didn't have the least idea of how I went to <unk>
I teamed up with her brother and her father there at that very accurate time, "All right, this is Tony <unk> going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inner can't be able to do it.
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research, which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer you draw about that and you register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that are <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much move things around one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies and we get a machine that would be able to take a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> this guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers around the world -- all of the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, children and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and when they <unk> they would have taken out the walls of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> ride my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a pair of cheap sun glasses that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and that's free -- we published the code <unk> the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital that I can say.
Any person with paralysis you have access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And then more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense courses from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been underwater and someone finally came to <unk> and they would get me out of there so that I could take it out.
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a chain <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the best invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the center of the L.A. in the center of Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, it can happen.
Nothing in this room is possible -- the computer stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like we have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations generally very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous mine.
Film areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat it only -- fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I have been dealing with it in situations as awful with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that we build interesting, interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that you see fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and take a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of them on Twitter, volunteered in sale on the name of my TEDTalk of 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as content could be <unk> in my face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago, I couldn't tell them for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world <unk> of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could be done for something so difficult or so dangerous as you enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that deals with the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film would be <unk> with <unk> marketing and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The greatest film ever <unk> is that all of the top down at the bottom, actually has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? <unk> Is it <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X <unk> in the title -- but we're going to make sure we can use all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we would take a shoe and then get the most cool shoe you <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The greatest movie ever <unk> the best drink that you've got <unk> <unk> from "The <unk> <unk> ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The film <unk> is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help them help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive people are going to be.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> -- John <unk> -- I think it's going to be difficult to meet them but certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big ones.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be touched.
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of it.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible as possible, and so many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media today, and old media scenario and the <unk> scenario is not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that will bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error -- and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: the <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information -- being the last line perhaps the biggest line probably the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president <unk> even the CEOs of <unk>
But all of a sudden, when it comes to the fact that it is actually changes suddenly changes.
But why? Well, the transparency day --  -- like that weird bear that still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to be <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was <unk> in some lie -- and there he looks like, as he used to say, "Son, there's three sides in history.
It's your story, and it's my story, and it's history <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many -- I realized I would have to go on my mind -- I would have to take off the <unk> and go to the businesses myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out from suddenly -- and I began to give me <unk> is that when you start talking about the business of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big films that make big movies and some of them who make small movies -- independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make a big, big Hollywood movies say that the reason why their movies are so successful because of the markings associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The <unk> <unk>
How are we going to see <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out every time I open up my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody can say "You're cool for this <unk>
You're ready? Do you see a little nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have so much for man like to <unk> <unk> to <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we have -- we're pretty much a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brand.
So doing things like that, you know, to remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Woman: navigation.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something hot <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you cool more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those of the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Get my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, many gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing fastest, like sunglasses, and I like <unk> and I like <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand of <unk> it could be a <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: On the hippie part of the <unk> partly <unk> -- I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They sell toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: No. <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I am <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all all be brand Tom, but I often wake up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family picture.
A: <unk> a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> from that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that we <unk> as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and they start in a place and in my case come back and start in my family, West Virginia.
AT: What is the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like things different.
I like things like that. I like things like that.
A: <unk> from the <unk> why does that serve us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Let's get a little bit about that.
<unk> little more than you are.
What else did you get? Have you <unk>
You may not have to be afraid. What kind of mountain are you?
MS: Thank you. <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> (Audience: <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to get out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your own personality of <unk> the Morgan <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
It was very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to be <unk> in one of your strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend to -- and it's nature -- to avoid the things that they're not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them a little bit positive for you, and you make them become a positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and brands on those things that have gone and come -- but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
Are you a attribute of <unk> You're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool as the <unk> contemporary -- and <unk> <unk> or audacious like <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical -- as <unk>
Or are you more <unk> <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated like <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You're reliable -- stable, familiar, safe, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to become part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they didn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing and movie for film.
We went to San Paulo where the ads have forbidden into the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there is nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting together in the schools with the money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest answer or where I've been more successful are those where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how he has gone? It was success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million colors in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we talk about, they will be <unk>
I have always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that on those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that, it's pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss of risk is preparing their entire company to protect them from rewards.
I feel that what is going to happen to advance is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's go forward, I think we have to give place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to meet transparency.
Now more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> big data in big opportunities for companies all over the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket -- I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my <unk> TED year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Its biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were able to engage these systems that are controlled and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective computer virus on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the plan.
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started thinking about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed like I want to do something with these boxes, these control systems.
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they were very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And then of experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is effectively working in that location.
If not, <unk> it doesn't do anything.
So that struck my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could be, let's say, for example, a power plant plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to go to the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two pumps -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
We would take all the dots that we attack.
They probably even know how much it would take the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high tech, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning was calls into the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to engage with the real world, with potential potential goals.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals about goals, we remember that it's definitely an violent, <unk> should be a white <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
There are no thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the power of nuclear energy from <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort to raise their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate that little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious obvious effort to go crazy to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better at it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in between hands.
It wasn't like this.
The results have been off with several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Yet we found that both digital <unk> would come to one single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about the other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really got myself wrong.
There's the gray box and up the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the entrance values for example, from pressure sensors and <unk> sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this fake entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds out of video <unk>
It's great huh?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators of the control of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine goes down, you have to open wells of escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, obviously.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can explode.
And neither is the <unk> no security system <unk>
It scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology from worms to <unk>
It would be more possible.
And if we <unk> that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better that we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main <unk> behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take up and give you any other <unk> or another one that will make users on the wheels get up and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and helps you for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier that, on average, has to take over its back a thousand pounds, and you get <unk> to bring even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk> Human Human Project.
Soldier: With the <unk> <unk> I can take you 90 pounds for a lot of hours.
Your flexible design allows you to put up in <unk> <unk> and running moves with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk>
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of the wheels, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage in the spinal column that when their life is -- to be 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
And we also talk about the population that goes rapidly that is rapidly multiplying very quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the <unk> column and as a result, he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
Do you have a bunch of sensors.
It's completely not <unk> on the crutches who send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the moves to the bottom.
Little time later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never walk to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole me up to the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down to <unk> up the rocks and even riding on the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just by soldiers, but the question of all the users of the wheels, to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the jazz of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest living kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done very much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, <unk> the Bonobo Bonobo is in charge of female power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is not ever observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it has been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been spent for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
Illegal flesh trade and deforestation makes it fill up or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard of laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have frequent sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a child game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, we see the root roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is both common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a little <unk>
I think that, we sometimes play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside of our outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world to greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
<unk> is essential.
For bonobos and human <unk> it's not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate play, you can be the times the most <unk>
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as you love, creativity, friendship and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, I was eating fires as a fire assistant in a fire department volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers were, in a highly qualified staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain of the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas -- <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go in and would save the dog dog dog.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a fire building to save an live live only because I won by five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to fall between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> firemen that at that height and less had finished off off the <unk> and he went into a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back down the ladder where I met my <unk> and the next dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house for the owner of home where, as he was to wait, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort that he demonstrated to save his house.
The kindness she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
So both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary fireman witness and a <unk> acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have been there, or are you using a remarkable success levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you take a little bit now.
They took food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence your life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block of concrete.
The first concrete blocks was built in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of a fixed measure of a fixed measure that fit around with each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called a <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came home.
It's been estimated that they've been over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply took the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that year in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> aesthetic <unk> each other on a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of concrete, the transistor allows to create much bigger circuits and more complex and more complex circuits.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing them the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they put together with magnets.
So you can't get it wrong.
The bricks have a gene code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make older circuits.
A <unk> blue is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> <unk> to create more impact and we have a <unk> machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really very powerful.
Instead of having to learn to connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it <unk> faster or slower it just turn this button into this button that makes the pulse it's faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sound, solar cells, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given children to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works at night, or why the door of an elevator is still open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics are beginning to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a barrel of <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can actually visit the website, download all of the design and design records and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking to engage with the environment that we're focusing on in the environment.
distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I think the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members of a year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them the wildlife <unk>
They were working with great <unk> they worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears to be a quote, but what it really is looking for is that somebody else gets caught up when it gets caught up by snow, because he knows that it's not very good at every meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment that was very much about last year.
They realized that the city had never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component here.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other other technology.
And it extends viral form.
One responsible for <unk> systems of <unk> when we see this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work on this tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
So he asked the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just launch it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this doesn't happen.
<unk> of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they were done by the normal canals would have taken at least two and side and side of two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that even the time has 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral basis, is a kind of shot shot to the government of the government.
It suggests the better ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
You haven't given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration that's going to be, but they don't know it -- you know.
And these people know something we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we let the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that are putting us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because they don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> of us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way it thought to affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be able to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I have come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It is the place that the phone calls if you mark the <unk>
Scott <unk> This phone call.
<unk> <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no telephone center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile web called <unk>
You don't have that application.
It was the work of really smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this was really, actually gets this <unk> <unk> in my bucket cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, and I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income, to distributed voluntary volunteer society.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of a platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And I could have connected them with the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, we will save the communities.
If we call control of animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but you think you're the input of the other.
That our entry system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will <unk> our values, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 feet.
This is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is that <unk> what keeps us from that is that we funded as something that we are going on against us that something that is something that is in our against the other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy be <unk>
Because that's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk>
It's a group of concerned that they have written by a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is <unk> activism.
And for those of us who have <unk> ourselves in front of the government, it's time for us to ask, what world do we want to leave to our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
You really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on the name of everyone?
We can't do without the government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root of the government so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old and I, to <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about, who are all going to speak.
They can express their opinions at any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the problem of the government -- they don't really care about doing their voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring hands to the work to program applications that make better work better to government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> dumping them a garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned up those fire hydrants and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning to have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I don't really learned this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a African-American family dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in all of the discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia with <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked at the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good story.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would go back and say, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to come back to me again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and she said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I went through the room, I took out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. The two will <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
And she said, "Now I wish I didn't do it. I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I have been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do, is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to figure out that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you'll always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then finally said, "The third thing I want you to do, is that you never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother <unk> and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We barely got the <unk> of always, as usual.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, I'm going to go <unk> but I'm not going to take a <unk>
My brother said, <unk> you know, <unk> And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
And I went through the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, you won't be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells us all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I say it for the power that the identity.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think that my grandmother believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we did with it, we should have <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is now very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this massive mass in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of the three black people between the 18 and the 30 years is in prison or the parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all the young color in the color or the parole.
Our system is not just distorted in the race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these aren't problems with us.
We are <unk>
It seems to me interesting.
We're looking at our work at some very good developments in my work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you have copyright care about whether you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over to the next 10 years, the level of rights loss to be as high as it was before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country of the world where <unk> boys were killed in prison.
We have this country in prison for children, without any chance to come out.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They encourage people to death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, you've got to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the crimes that are <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by mistake.
Every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent who is <unk> and released from the death row.
An innocent rate <unk> an innocent one.
This is interesting.
In aviation you wouldn't be able to fly flying airplanes if every nine that would be, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I'm talking about slavery, <unk>
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the reconstruction and it lasted to World War II.
We really don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
He worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and tell me, "Mr. Stevenson, you taught talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. We grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with the segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
And all the time we were putting together with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> and racial without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we were going to have a <unk>
<unk> about this.
How are we going to focus on a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We wouldn't be able to do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love your entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate both of those.
I talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never will come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside of our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
We are. Even though it was so rational, so rational as committed to the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the <unk> of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also the dark thing in the dark.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, one will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no <unk> related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young, young lawyer from met <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, I was called me to go, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and get it out.
I said, "Yes, "I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, let me tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I began to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted unfairly.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice management.
We try to end up the sentences of life, without freedom hanging out for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to finish the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and I end up looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got <unk> he put my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
So I've been <unk> for simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each of us is higher than the worst thing we have to do.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, isn't because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge us by our technology, by our designs, not for our intellectual or rational ability to be rational or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas are going beyond myself in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been convicted of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years, which have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it isn't about?
The judge would take it as an adult, but I see a child.
And one night very late I was awake <unk> for God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't are, should have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a small, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> so that my black client from 14 years is treated like a privileged white of 75 years executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country, there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had the <unk> but he had sent it to court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, I heard my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got in the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man, was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you?" I said yes.
And then I got bored and <unk>
And I was interested in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk>
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
And the policemen came up the cops <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everybody furious because we were talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I reached the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I would look down the window, and you can hear all that <unk>
Just walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black one, with a face of concern, he walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black man.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young woman to keep his view in the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral <unk> of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be attached to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, for those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, in this community, to help in your way to do something.
Something that is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which an effort is going to be an effort to deal with the funds that are spending today in policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases don't fit in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to get the law to make the law for the security.
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
This is why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain that are driven by stealing a bicycle, by small crime against property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every single second of every day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters most to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.
The amygdala is our early warning -- the <unk> detector.
<unk> and recorded all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> stories of stories, looking at the negative stories.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood, you know, it's very true.
And given that all digital devices give us negative news for seven days, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe, instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress conducted in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> we certainly have them.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long -- we just had them.
Let's look at the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita adjusted for inflation has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles yelled at 25 percent of 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue <unk> higher expectations higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we overestimate the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the Cold century, the <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and, lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend, Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that shows up in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time in the war and peace, in the peace, in <unk> and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and networks, and the robotics -- 3D printing and its ability to democratize production around the planet, synthetic biology, fuels -- vaccines and food, the digital medicine, the fuel and the <unk> the digital medicine, the <unk> and the A.I. of the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on <unk> "Jeopardy" of <unk>
It was <unk>
I tried to <unk> the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to <unk> beings."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy play.
Play with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available to everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and, in particular, how can they be used to solve great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a product or a service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a group of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every <unk> in the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and it's <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> story in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
Let's make this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on an entire planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about 1949, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell off 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents a <unk> per hour compared to the 15 cents a national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed me pointed out the spacecraft that Voyager on the Earth, in 1990, after it passed <unk>
I took a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, <unk> is fresh water, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, give me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any fresh source, saltwater, fresh water -- <unk> <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that this is going to be a Coca-Cola is going to be transformed into <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an innovation that's happening by this technology that now exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better communications communications in Kenya than the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And if you have a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever happened.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid the tens of tens of thousands of dollars -- video, <unk> video <unk> images, of books and music technology, <unk> diagnostic technology -- now they are <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get it to you when it comes to the applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can bring these technologies into a mobile device with which they speak, and because they have <unk> they can be able to get blood out of your finger.
To win it has to do better <unk> than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the 25 percent of health workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that you don't want to call the health care -- and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What <unk> What would you mean?
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of Academy of Academy and because of using 3D impressions and the computer in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about a little bit of voices, never before it <unk>
What if we give them the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and could act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 million?
And if they're contributions we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X <unk> is that small teams guided by his passion with a clear goal, can do things that were <unk> things that they could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
It was at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this professors of college among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came up and started <unk>
And it's been shown that the machinery of human patterns is better than <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are going to engage us to work on the solution of the great challenges and do what we should do.
We have ahead of a few decades old.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that I pursued <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a <unk>
It was the <unk>
He got it very much to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still says they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying an <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I grew up to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from the <unk>
He had <unk> from about 20 cents, a black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was making it over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there, 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
It goes down to the five centimeters tall.
You know, a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing for changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly -- it's called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South Sea <unk> and especially in the Ross Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were coral, other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are tiny spots on a little bit of <unk> the remains of the coral reef.
In short, the sea floor came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that they collect fishermen every time you go to an area where they've never fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't recall it.
<unk> the beginning of starting the next level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis -- we have things like this, biodiversity, number of <unk> <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use the images received to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the type of changes.
And at the end, I keep a <unk>
And that, in great measure, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before it's <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea with a lot of big fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> which was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a prior way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them <unk> as a captain of the captain of the way that you know, a lot of fish in this area can't be used, or usually not use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From the enormous role that it can accomplish a protected area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we actually actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think of it, because the starting point has run out and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected protected zone and can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
What about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema may actually fill the void.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> I will talk about the story of <unk> why they <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something which, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that would give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I am Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are done <unk> and what importance does that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of the percentage of those, receive lots of visits and make cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators and <unk> communities, surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video taken out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> at the peak of the early summer.
<unk> is not meant to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video to the <unk>
The trends like Jimmy <unk> give us new things and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everyone wants you to get a weekend, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. Get up on a Friday.  KA: So I won't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday in particular <unk>
Well, he took <unk> and lots of blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people in making a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of creators take a point of view and share it with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great joke that is actually starting to talk about it and do things.
And now there are 10,000 dollars of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a <unk> version that has been seen with four million times.
Up until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that aroused between the Internet community community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it became international it.
Suddenly, a whole community came up with a whole community, which made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we all can make part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written to be written by that?
In a world where two days video days of video just a minute, just that unique and unexpected can tell you the way these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great clip of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in a lot.
Casey <unk> I was beaten by not circular by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly from the <unk>
KA: Because of the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million watching and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of participation, creative communities, all the unexpected, are features of a new media kind of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't be allowed to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little bit of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- they are just the current media, but it would be <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose whole life had been supported in the only of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in no avail.
The words, for so long, friends, they will do it.
It was <unk>
He died <unk>
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let it have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old, when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was meant to have a <unk> task to escape their family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a four year-old <unk> that defies fiction, a boat stayed in to the sea of <unk> ship.
All the adults know the risks.
The greatest fear were <unk> rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with a poison.
If we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came up several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to tear for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform facing the coast of Malaysia, and the young man that collapsed and died, finish the journey was too <unk> and the first apple that I tasted was given by the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants in.
Unlike the middle of the middle class <unk> whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was traded between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, doesn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> that generally was <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
<unk>
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating by determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day, and we were hearing the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares was to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> and <unk> boys between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student <unk> with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of they got help over the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of college, I was elected by the Australian boy.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't exist.
As a <unk> resident <unk> a <unk> resident was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence she'd never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life on a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years old, <unk> on the day of every single one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had the same age as she had when she got the boat.
He hadn't been an option.
<unk> he said, "What is not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more I was talking about to talk about.
I met people from all the roads of life, many of them doing what they were living on in the border of the possible.
And although I finished my graduate work, I realized I couldn't stay in a law of law.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new fan on the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that is grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
He gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, an <unk> optimism mixture of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
They went to a small group of people for whom the slogan cannot be <unk> it was a compelling.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I would make a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ones, and we opened up the walk.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I wrap up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't change for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised alone.
The 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused a <unk> to <unk> and take the cause she was, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have been wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel in a hotel in <unk> when she died, a thousand miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother named minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
On the night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who were and how life we get together, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat had easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want that to want that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy one.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a courageous one in each wave, the <unk> constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that don't guarantees anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them -- they would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of the way here is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with an airplane.
At that time, when I <unk> the great Indian thought: I had <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> to the floor, got water.
We now do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced with magic.
And that was really excited about that.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I would tell me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me a gift of his pocket.
And this piece of technological <unk> was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them out.
We have our inspiration.
And so I <unk> I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I published books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do is that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
In several times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic of childhood, those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned into <unk>
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy was in a <unk>
So here, every book and every book becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device, inside the device.
And it opens up a map.
In every single fantasy book there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor guys have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old old book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history of <unk>
In a story that's about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> they attached to their <unk> they have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> stones, stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual we have to go out and, in a chapter, they would take a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
An London kid puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
An Indian kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have a interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality of course, you see a cartoon group of cartoons that appear about the plants inside the house.
At a moment, the screen is filled with leaves at a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology come closer to each other.
It's going to be the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why a lot of <unk> <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was attached to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> are failing, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's very simple.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I got <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when you need <unk> <unk> or any urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than four Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before I get up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure that is used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available now.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were wandering from their houses, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back and reclaim the control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention care and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with you with a video video.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are ATMs in <unk>
Where are they all <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one did any <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it is open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was looking for application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cell phones from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to provide global worldwide.
We are <unk> to all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They could be messaging services, or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that is shown is still in their place.
Please hang on this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was awakened with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, the photograph had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
You know, <unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful and <unk> but with the common goal to maintain the level of his eyes.
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it sound real?
They're the details or the <unk>
Do light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that even seems like <unk> as if we were.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
Does it really combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look realistic I think these are those ones that don't even solve the things around us in our daily lives.
But when I combine photographs is very important -- because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will keep to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are combined to have the same kind of light.
And these two images are popping up with these <unk> they made the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect fight.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal hand, I think it's easier to create a place that it is because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone pit of stone.
And yes, even the house of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic result I think it takes planning.
You start with a sketch, an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful, and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing one slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one I took from a folder for me.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> it's new.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
It's more intensity, because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to tell you the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask -- for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you have a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology is as fast as we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But don't go through that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development, which every single few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- looking at these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
Let's get one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we are in a transition from what it used to be the world, a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new shape to adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because you feel something is going on.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that transition could be, how it could be that transition that you get.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So you go back about half a half thousand years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that would be surrounding them.
If we look at the way those chemicals <unk> we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, there were some oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical recipes on their inside.
Some of those blobs were held a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring out materials from the outside and so <unk> grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most respected cell forms of those oil <unk>
But those drops not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you <unk> it would be <unk> by the chemical distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So every <unk> it was a little different.
In fact, drops that in a way that would be <unk> being better at the time to bring out the chemicals -- more and more chemicals and more chemicals and more <unk>
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things will be interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't understand very well about these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this sort of meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to be able to do for.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide the security people from the airport.
But <unk> Tom <unk> The code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and it would have taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things were going to be very different -- and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming that cell community.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, <unk> antibiotic resistance.
Some of the bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to place that they would get communities that, in a way, they were together in that way, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community were getting more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came over so much that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have local communities in many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not good without the heart, or the muscles.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit, because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism, because they had built these processing structure of information that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit of their fruit.
And so the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that we have accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now be confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea -- an idea of the <unk>
I'm here sitting here sitting around emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea -- <unk> and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in the other brain.
That allows us to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to do abstractions.
We now go through similar periods to <unk> organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and presentation processing and information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video tape, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which it produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took for a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The next bit of language, they took less than a million years.
And the ones like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that are working for <unk> would not be possible without the recent IT advances.
But now design objects from such a complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't do it, get much further and faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
Do we say, "Please take a hundred million lines of instructions to chance?
You could run these instructions of random <unk> to run all of those programs, and take those of those programs, what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to elaborate numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to setting up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, was able to find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did <unk>
And we put those things into the rest.
And now we <unk> the ones that we better bring up the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a <unk> process.
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who are <unk> and that kids will take the properties of both programs.
So we can get a new generation of a product of the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
It would bring some mutations in.
And it tries again to get it to another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that were <unk> numbers in a very perfect way.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've been trying to do it to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know, I've got the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I was once in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulled out a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make a different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex than the normal engineering.
Yet we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it is <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think stop here before I get to me.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that should change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give up some of my false <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great team of baseball.
I'll focus on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard of it.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means that the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and anyone who's trying to throw it to the first base -- not to get it to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> <unk>
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League <unk> of <unk> to run more <unk> at a regular season.
Now I <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> the surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a distant place, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor goes through a cardiologist whose record record is <unk>
But know what?
She's getting better at this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But let me ask you.
What do you think you should be the average of the <unk> of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I include the mandate of being perfect.
And that never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was at medical school.
I was a obsessional obsessional student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied was a <unk>
Such it.
<unk> in my little <unk> on the <unk> nurses of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and muscle labor, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the HIV <unk> and the frequent <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you go to everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible, I close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady back to the emergency service to the emergency emergency service.
At the time, I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied it to a emergency school, I was going to attend that patient.
and reporting the head of residents.
When I saw <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which is that I had a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> your blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was able to do.
I gave him <unk> and medication to ease the pressure on his heart.
I gave him a little bit of water, so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was going to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to bring information into it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to spend constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
They sent it to her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner who said, <unk> not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse that I would call the lady <unk> <unk> who is okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and the ambulance with the ambulance with the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a <unk> <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I would take it to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. At the time I did something that I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency emergency service service.
And there another nurse, not that I was talking about the lunch lady before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most of the emergency emergency.
Other specialists who fear them, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients, <unk>
The three words are remembers you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And he said, she <unk> with the same tone <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and the edge of the death.
At the end of an hour I had reached her home, after I gave the high school, suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room with a pressure of 50 millimeters -- which means a <unk> <unk>
I just barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff, all their resources.
They gave up medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and expected against all the hope they were going to be.
And in the age of two or three days it was obvious that we never will.
I had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they <unk> what was happening.
And in ninth day, they let them go. The lady, <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks I got excited about it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get them with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And so that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I am sure that I would take things down, and he made sure that I didn't get sick.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why was he sent to his house?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little <unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in one day, he was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I was able to raise the efforts to be perfect for not to make any more errors, I would do to cease those voices.
And so did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was an emergency department in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, <unk>
He <unk> penicillin and he sent him home.
But as he ran the door to the door was still pointing out his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: Does you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
He came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it goes top, and that can the close top of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, she didn't die.
He was able to get antibiotics out of it, and they have regained the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back, and he went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times on the same emergency turn of the <unk> don't be <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
He took an X-ray of an kidneys but it turned out normal. A colleague that was checking the patient checking a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called a surgeon.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I checked it and notice a bit of sensitivity in the bottom law, I called a surgeon.
Both were operated on and they recovered well.
But every single case I'm going to tell you about it.
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get to me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show them this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I could now go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after <unk> after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust you would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> that make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as a antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you care about medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a secure system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical litigation and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto over to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in every 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where respiratory infections are increasingly and more <unk> by chaos and death.
In this country, 80,000 Canadian <unk> for medical mistakes.
The U.S. U.S. Institute set <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so things are.
A <unk> system, where knowledge is going on every two or three years, and we don't care about us.
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain that comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and, suddenly, my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminated all the professional professionals who are going to error, well, not no one.
And with respect people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And their students got <unk> <unk> their head and <unk> and they started to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to be able to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we could do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
Human doctor is human, they know human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody to get <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human, I would make mistakes.
And I feel a lot but I am to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
And I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick up an American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot ago, in research on a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks for these CEOs and the time that we will try to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of his time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How did they grade the way that you're decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
While I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for giving you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I <unk> this <unk> supermarket very, very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was like 250 different types of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we had water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in a box called <unk> trees coming from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses filled with tourists which came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of classes.
You put a post to <unk> right to the entrance to the store.
So we put it out there six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had a 60, when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what if they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we found the opposite effect.
What stopped when there were only three percent of them going to buy <unk>
If there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably got <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the energy overload is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when we didn't get it.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, from about 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of opportunities available for savings plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two, to 59 options.
What we found was that the older people were the number of funding that were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they want.
And in the plans that put about 60 funding, the rate of participation landed at <unk> 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choice, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the larger it was the number of choices, more people will be transferred to avoid actions or hedge funds.
In the way that there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial prices.
But none of these most extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences of providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we will make the decision, that <unk> even when it goes against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
Are you more likely to pick things down, even even though objectively they will.
The main reason is that we <unk> by looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you about four simple techniques that we've <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their businesses.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of odd choices, there will be an increase in sales, you have an increase in sales, you have a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went out of 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15 percent rise in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation eliminated the products to get rid of cats that are less <unk> they grew up the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and less costs.
You know that today's <unk> on average, they have 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, you give about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is a <unk> David <unk>
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a life fund of life.
The people who want to choose, are given 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all options <unk>
The first thing I do is we ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it either.
This evening, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience and a vacation with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk>
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I actually met more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information at the first <unk> than in the second, but I can tell you that the second time was real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between the differences between each choice, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must be very difficult in very concrete ways.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit and when they use enough <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive than that.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
That meeting exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the staff to think about the positive things that they would be interested in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories that options.
For example, this is a study we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in the <unk> <unk> along the corridor of the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> applause) well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This is completely useless.
<unk> have to tell you something to you who are <unk> not when they were <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
I mean who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if we just get it a little bit.
We need to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision buying a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows for <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, so you have to put your car.
And these choices vary in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> <unk> <unk> I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is cause the order to make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just a few boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to say?
How about you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
And we found that the ones that go from many choices to times, put the <unk> button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information is presented with information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even if you pick the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> we can drive more categories of categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, to use them in their own issues, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of choice is being careful by <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1950s, in East Germany, it <unk> if you had a writing machine, it was <unk> to the government.
You had to register a piece of text from example with the machine.
And so that government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a written written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much that we would give you the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and you print a page, that page will end up having a little yellow print on each page that you get a pattern of one and your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, let's pretend to make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their dates online, but they do it by illegal means using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy the <unk> or steal our keys to get the information from our cards when we buy on a computer <unk>
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know the <unk>
And I say there are more likely that any of us are a victim of a genuine crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong in the worse.
In the future, most crimes are online online.
The second group of <unk> on importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, the protests, they motivate us the opinions, they motivate them laughter laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying an enormous role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States of the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall of the last fall because of a <unk>
We put the safety of the site and organize a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government -- asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> by killing people of people because of the attack of <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of a attack of these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And they gave them the <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt <unk> the headquarters of the Egyptian police officer in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And inside that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had been sold by the Egyptian government tools to intercept a huge scale of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros the government <unk>
The company headquarters are right here.
But the Western governments -- they provide them tools to keep governments in order to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The connection to the Internet.
We had even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be said, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but I don't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's <unk> privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, whatever right today, it will be forever.
Be blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south of National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at the most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt really bad because it was the only <unk>
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of the lions.
They were dying as warriors that protect our community and livestock -- and they are also mad about the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared of.
But I realized that it really doesn't happen to me, because even helping male lions see the pen from far.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, "This thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come from.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch off the switch to turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a firefly <unk>
It would take everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load your battery and battery <unk> electricity into the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give out the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is what lions you see when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea also is used by Kenya, to frightening other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also being used for hacking elephants from farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Indian International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child on the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes fly, and he said it would someday be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in a plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to become a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electrical CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they were invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, you know, perhaps, right, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: In the <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to spend every step in every step that <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called no <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
At school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
I thought sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And to say, "When we <unk> this, the five member members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of past weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
As soon as I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
One woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at his face of his mom without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine went to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating insects, insects and <unk>
They also made more and more frequent <unk> the energy cuts -- everything around me was completely dark in the night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo from North Korea at night compared to the neighbors.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought that would be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just incredibly difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a fear fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> me in the police station.
Somebody had accused of being <unk> so I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
It was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another one, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of you can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after a harsh <unk>
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> in North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Though I was fortunate to escape many other North Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard only to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to take a <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call my <unk>
Even though I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money sent to my family, and, as my family was going to be shifted to force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to take it in a way, for over 3,000 kilometers across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by an official police officer.
He asked the identification of all, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately he believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the <unk> guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned for crossing the <unk> border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything for liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to short distance from the <unk>
I was coming up between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary -- I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I read it up with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown would be a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when they were <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the amount of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little money.
So we can benefit from the international community to education, practical language, practice practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact with family family inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspired in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, terrain.
So the planners of the city came together and said, "We're going to change the South Center for the South Africa to represent something else, so they changed the Los Angeles to South Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles -- <unk> of <unk> fast food, terrain.
Like <unk> millions of other other Americans, live in a food desert, the Los Angeles South Central Center for food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to take more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles South <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of your house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as a self-driving cars.
I saw <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of riding 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a forest of food in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters x me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me on wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we got together and we started planting our forest of food, <unk> trees, you know, nine <unk> vegetables, you know.
What we do, we are kind of a <unk> group made by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then somebody gets <unk>
The city got to me on top of me and <unk> I had a <unk> saying that I had to remove my yard, the <unk> made a <unk>
And I was saying, "Come on, right?
An order judicial to plant food on a piece of land than no one was <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had been written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It has 18 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> millions of <unk>
Why the hell don't look well like this?
<unk> a plant give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivates your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up with my kids there.
I'm going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to <unk> my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I'm growing my art.
As an artist from <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became a tool of education, in transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how the kids.
<unk> is the <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
You also get <unk>
I remember one time, who came to a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt you see people who were so close to hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people are asking me, <unk> not temes that people will go to steal your <unk>
I mean, by God no, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
So that's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, and they shared their stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant it with his mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how they changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who are from, and they work and <unk> all of them in a volunteer plan.
If the kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If they grow tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of these are being taught if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, they eat blind to what you put on front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they are stuck. I see kids that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you get the next George Washington Post.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plan -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I don't know.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free, it's not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, bring the streets to the street, who know the joy, the pride and their honor to grow their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Would you get them to take their <unk>
That is its weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not going to be called if they want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making crap.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we could plant something.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains, a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you're going on on your bike and these cars go and go and go and do that is not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a <unk> road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and the water can go through it, so all the water water flow over the sides and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't waste water anymore.
Noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, the whole noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the stones on the surface of the surface goes out of it.
First, a stone, then several more and more and more and more and more, etc., and then ... well, I won't do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> it's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how damage is the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt -- as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and they separate from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use wool wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the wool from steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> may heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the flow of the flow of these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
I used an <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big machine back here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, that I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial kind of machine in the lab to heat the <unk>
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a test lane try this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road road to several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did age the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using fiber of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, and you can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, it has to cool first before I can show you how repairability works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC and News in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually going to do it.
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who no longer could be alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route for nobody to suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house -- more than 100 of us in a little room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school took suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you were <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was so fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> when her daughter, my mother, my mother, went to school, and so her father will do it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of her family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do.
So you still want to do that.
I am 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find me proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, I carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
This is why I am the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite even in front of an opposition <unk>
Like <unk> It's not the true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if she kept sending her daughter to school, they would be going to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but it doesn't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who have a parent who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the <unk> of Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
So we would say that these changes are not <unk> a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I look back at Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were telling them for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls from <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream of it.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men, young men were at the middle of the regime, the fall of the regime, they were carrying billboards for dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a loss of loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a huge load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved it, along with many other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a top-down transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started to organize workshops about the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, <unk> counseling and <unk> to advocate for women's autonomy of the woman and for our right to participate in the <unk> of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that are <unk> of the selfish policies of domination, and being able to abuse it.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and ancient <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the U.S. officer.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made by a political mindset becomes more <unk> and has come away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today for us today to do with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I am here today to confess that we, as a nation we choose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability to Libya.
<unk> list, and <unk> between candidates and candidate peace and reconciliation.
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of more consensus than it needed the election, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the ultimate representation of the best you need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also putting the mercy of the <unk> instead of the <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion in place of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, desperately needs to be desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the other female and male lives.
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which spans all of the humanity of men and women that all the tribes and all people have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows in, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
So it comes to us, "My mercy is going on all the things."
So it says, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
And that we all become fascinated by the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a mathematical question, which has an equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that I'm going to deal with is that everyone is going to ask why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who got a <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He was just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and an editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret to it.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul -- I was attached to my head with a <unk> loaded with bullets in the <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological cheat in love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at the English University of Harvard and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the <unk> list, <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I've been married for about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the health levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long duration of the other way, in the families, the last place that we would want or would expect or find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who <unk> it and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24-year-olds have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of it in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- which was a list that had gone to Harvard, who had been a passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go out of New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I'd have to do sacrifices for your partner and so on, I left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering head at a physical trap and financial and psychological care.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those guns.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to be able to feel so safe to buy three guns.
One had the car <unk>
Another is kept underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed these guns because of trauma that lived from tiny.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message to me and, although I had never lifted me my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack came out five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the top 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I put her from my mom and married with him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we were living happily in forever, because I loved it, and he was also really interested in it.
And I was very, very <unk>
He simply had a sense of <unk> by the wedding and for the fact to form a family with me.
He had been a isolated accident, and I would never be harm.
I spent twice as much as our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that we <unk> several times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey. He was <unk> by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> went on for a couple of times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I thought about it when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had a very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face their <unk>
The other question everyone does is: Why don't you just get <unk>
Why did I not bother me, I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that makes people, because we us, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the murder cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally been left to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to protect the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not being gone.
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, so I would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone to the world: the police, my neighbors and my friends and family friends, full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines, <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do they <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> were deliberately <unk> by men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a critical lesson from what happened to them and that they <unk> their lives of joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I loved marrying with a cute little man, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What will not come back to ever have ever else, would ever be a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
Right now, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but this whole time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they are being <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my particular love to be silent.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Love abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence by simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
It <unk> the <unk> of the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family and family.
Tell them their vision of survivors like fantastic and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the dramatic signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe.
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis of safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel like this is a <unk> tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed like this.  Luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck in <unk> I think.
If some of the women <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go and find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These days, they are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater on the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while covers me in the head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what you thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I took your back, and I would give him the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like that I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how does it be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my heritage future that I have known enough to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> that we keep going. There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> by knowing both models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is that less than four percent, they weren't white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be model when you get up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I would really tell you about one of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or an orthopedic surgeon and a poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> head of American journal <unk> or the <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that the larger you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you run your studies, you have a copy and you have a couple of jobs to your backs, no matter what you might like to say, if you pretend to be president of the United States, but your curriculum.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture I got to me, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have even my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two photos are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people from <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, do things for free?
I have too many too many inches tall, and I never use, except the <unk> but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red <unk> and, of course, we were <unk> and he was sorry, and I was sorry, an agent that could keep going <unk>
I was able to get some of these privilege out of the way you look, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price of how no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and Latino 86 percent were black men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
I think about how many times I get <unk>
By researching this talk, I learned that to the 53 percent of the 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the <unk> hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also amazing to be able to work with creative people, ingenious and <unk>
And that's all true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say we are in front of the cameras that I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and my smartest hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs, the brightest hair and clothing in the fashion -- but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of oppression and gender and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable at recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have of the success and the failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a small care in light.
In fact, most of them were taken random tourists.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife dragged me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching my third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera on a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much it would change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a 10-year-old girl could be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific trip.
They're also a way to stop time in a October week and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although you always got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see the life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the movie store that <unk> small at previous <unk>
And he described to me what had felt like the five years of foot on that same place.
It reminded me that I remembered their heart <unk> with strength by the first time nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York is universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't leave in many of the family pictures.
I'm always getting it out of the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I don't want to go on to get someone and ask him, and take it a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group of birds.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, such as <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   Are you far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So, why are you going to <unk> First of all, first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that not to be for them would spread and would cause huge losses of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of <unk>
<unk> also have an enormous <unk>
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and <unk> Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're going to be very important about open <unk> in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or the wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a system of natural <unk>
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are very extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> -- <unk> communities use this venom against predators and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years are <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey of the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk>
This drug has been banned for <unk> in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there have been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs -- you have a huge amount of time for <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the major wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from the lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so to focus on a public problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the regional levels of regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can they help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them to tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> <unk> and you have to focus on these very <unk> <unk> of the word.
When you get out of this room, you'll tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed because he saw without effort, no energy energy <unk>
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I don't.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
So instead of that, everything we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where we were lucky, and we decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we've got to have a lot of <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local <unk> and Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they did not be <unk>  We were apart from the local in such fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking how it was possible that we don't hear anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow into this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy is the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to them, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk>
And I thought that only we were Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they did what they were doing, what they did -- and then seeing what they were doing, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was released in 2009.
We, Western countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that that money has been <unk>
They just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> and we treat people just of two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I'm trying to deal with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, I want you a lot."
I'm trying to deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- said, <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can actually imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion -- the <unk> of the local people who have a dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, they will be <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never be told at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor from the company, the family doctor -- the family doctor who are established with you in their house, on your kitchen table, and that helps to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a <unk> trial of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in the time, trying to get away from this garbage <unk> where we got to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And then the government was <unk>    So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most grandiose business <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they become involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
The planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now you have <unk> reconstructing no knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer you for privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What are you going to talk about, you know, more of this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the spirit of an entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossils -- not renewables, <unk> and at one point, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to think about is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who will invent technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year he came together with this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already dressed up at dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would save the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States in the United States appeared -- <unk> manufacturing companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in places that were <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they wouldn't come to talk to you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then later, you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have to be fantastic, you have to have to have a great financial <unk>
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We have tested and looked at the 100 World <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new <unk> Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have common, only one: no one was started by one person.
But the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in the bars along with their comrades together in the comrades in which you will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> somebody who is going to ask you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do it." <unk> that I can look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us guys can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge out of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects come from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and apologize.
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and dream?
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for a centuries ago, and I trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most <unk> of <unk>
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
Their death was sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this made me a deep gratitude for the lived time and this day.
It was clearly given to the significant things about my current life.
But I'm going to be able to keep this look in my daily lives.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to get out of the day and will forget how important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this left house on a giant slate and he painted on her sentences to <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk>   Before I die I want to sit on the line of change of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to give you more and more."
Before I died, I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about supporting the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and change it.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have been <unk> in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age, it was more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
Think about death <unk> our life.
Our space spaces can reflect better what we care about individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people that surrounds us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
Don't speak, but it comes joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love is.
It's shared. It will happen what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice about it: never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even do -- I could remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high.
Would you have the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me the year that she came out every year from my iPod <unk> conversations that we kept when I was four years old, <unk> on my arm for the first episode of <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, often they are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing: that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning.
In each individual it manifests itself out of a different way, that's so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
They lived alive and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I would be pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the car in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat the washing machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As he was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond <unk> frustration and frustration -- there was something really <unk> an absolute and innocent nature that I saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, times when I wish that they were just just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> and Sam and it would be you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift inside and honestly, the search for <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been being done in the <unk> of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications professor, and to give a class of communication to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> of the truth of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big words words.
But when those conversations, these conversations, I felt what it would have felt like when she fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
<unk> I felt like I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care -- among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as no scientists having these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure we can see that its science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
We don't tell us simply that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, carefully with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them silly ones.
Instead, as Einstein, as he said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate this science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you put his job, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you been wondering why they're called <unk>  What do we call <unk> The bullets were killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's <unk> too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that he really inspired the only of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that will be attached to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what you get.
I think these are just some keys that can help the other open to open the door and look at the country of wonders that's science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined her much better when he said, "A <unk> is the time that he searches for a public charge without matter or <unk> and when he wins, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament, allowed the British Parliament.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy who was named <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
Didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced to all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some they wanted to call it the <unk> state of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States.
Not very <unk>
Some of them simply wanted to call him <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want the Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call him King or to her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than it was happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were creatures <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "Well we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will be serious with a <unk> title, <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't survive.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Barack Obama is lucky to keep in there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to tell you is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and <unk> and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance of it, well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything you want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so forth.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to be humble when you tell them they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually reality changes much more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones -- <unk> with <unk> tools.
As everybody else, I have a cheap flashlight of light, attached to my head with this elastic <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that little subway hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep down in that hole in that hole in that hole has no <unk> and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there, I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a nonprofit that is involved in modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew it existed in the world, but not as degree.
When we end up talking to me, I was very sad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got a <unk> and a few weeks later, I flew in L.A. to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
A few of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative <unk> says that there are more 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans throughout the whole attempt to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> 50,000 today.
However, today you can enslave entire families for generations to <unk> debt, for 18.
Surprisingly, slavery generates profits from more than 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today, the slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those are producing disposable people.
<unk> exists in almost everyone -- and yet it's illegal for the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and tiredness work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 to 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee seat and eating it or to drink, and the severe <unk> would just pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was turned too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, like, my camera is getting a much better treatment for these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that was on my very quickly, grabbed me and said, <unk> Don't do it. Don't do it.
And he explained to me very clearly that to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a little worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and to work inside the system for his liberation and he trusted him to do it.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children lugging rocks for a mile through <unk> to trucks to the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than kids than the charge and the children would put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made of them and strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something that <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to do that?
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness told me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
I took me for a few <unk> <unk> which gave this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it's known as it is <unk> for prostitution prostitution at <unk>
They have small rooms -- they have small rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- they're forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each put dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their hands.
From the <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what is going to be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where we <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because they play a topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families in the silk trade.
This is a family dream.
The black hands are the father -- the <unk> blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and diving silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My <unk> told her stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, being able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came there, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what it seemed like to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger brothers, some more young children, make sense of it.
<unk> were all slaves.
The children are separated from their <unk> families who have been forced to work with large <unk> in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to it came up to be <unk> I mean his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of <unk> trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and <unk> and fear, they fall into the water to unleash branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and as the whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to be younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the same time.
It was in the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorbikes and all of a sudden sped up and surpassed our car and played the window.
It asked us to take it through the forest to the forest.
At the end of the way, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then it pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took out the <unk> that we took off the path and after walking near an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as they walked into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all filled with workers enslaved.
A lot of women had children strapped on their backs, and while they were looking for gold, they would take them in the waters of <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, tired, <unk> because many had been underground for 72 hours.
<unk> have to go down to 90 feet and these people have a heavy stone bags and then they will be transported to another area where they <unk> the rock to get the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the side, we see the other less fortunate, and also children.
All of them are victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle her uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I won the debt of the uncle what force to be slave in the mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the mines and 14 and the leg injury you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and <unk> with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in a remote possibility that inspires me.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give witness to them and to do everything we can to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are people, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I happen to do not think about these very many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn into a fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math, and there's a particular problem for whom we are <unk> we are like management management.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain <unk> initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, they gradually gradually like it with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous dancer ballet ballet ballet dance.
In the last few years, there is a lot of progress on the treatment.
But there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there is really a cure when we have an objective measure and objective <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not <unk> so they don't use the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, in the clinical trials, it's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do their exam <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do, as a conventional way to a try, you see, in a sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the vowels.
It shows someone very good while it emits a little bit of speech at talking, we can imagine as a dancers of a singing ballet because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes -- for example.
And, like <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects <unk> also affects the vowels.
In the bottom level, you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of the vowels.
We see the same <unk>
shake a vocal, <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they are both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also the scores of <unk> are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They're very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
So when something takes a cost that is so <unk> it appears on a mass scale.
These are some incredible goals ready to address.
We can reduce the patient difficulties.
I would no need to go to the clinic for pregnancy routine.
Often, we could get goals.
We could make a massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I give you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative.
Along and <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, and without disease, I can call it low price and leave it for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have no <unk>
<unk> You see, some people may not have <unk> You may not have it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data that we can do in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances that are important because we're looking for <unk> the <unk> factors for the actual markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this time?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job, and now it has been shown that works on the mobile phone network too, what we put on the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We tore ourselves into the dark, in no windows and we generally avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect -- we do the impossible, we can be able to be able to make it impossible, and we will focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of expertise and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where it was <unk>   <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
He traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing people located in the <unk> of <unk> almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water <unk> went over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the town was <unk>
Get rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and leave the house ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both of the volunteers and the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and camera cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
We would take them to different places of villages around the villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As we go from the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean up the toilets, gigantic <unk> gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until even beyond myself my horizons than something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them more than a hundred years in the lab -- some still were in the lab in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl who had a lot of <unk> and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of it itself, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got a lot more photos and they took more <unk> so that's that I entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
By the end of two weeks, I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got <unk> to <unk> a town on north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of time that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time you go in <unk> it's a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
She could be involved in an hour. I could be involved in weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using the areas whose color and detail of the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures long in seawater, covered with bacteria, with algae -- even with <unk> all of that along with the time I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless it was clean clean and would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As a <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures got these photos in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> she was stopped when he realized that they would get them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would be able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I collected their pictures shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues got it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their children small, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them remained trapped in the water.
She took a week to find her whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his photographs his younger son <unk> 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look at, something that could remember the past day that wouldn't have been marked on the day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them were helped us to clean up more than <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the great majority of them became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 hundred and hundreds of different photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take photos all the time.
One picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would get to us, but the first thing we would look at for looking for.
This was about the project, of restore little pieces of humanity, to bring someone back to someone with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, there's a huge difference in the life of the person who <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger, to give back, using your talent to something that not be thin skin of perfect skin.
So I would like to read this email. He sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I walked, I couldn't stop thinking about the people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me, because a similar picture of my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> <unk> out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the <unk> right?
Thank you.
Doc <unk> <unk> us inspired awe and curiosity.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> a new technical technique that can create videos in a slow motion of the light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see inside the body without using X-rays, and they defy really the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it into a <unk> second, you know, in a number of <unk> you can make a photons package of just a millimeter of a wide millimeter of a wide millimeter of a wide millimeter of just a millimeter of a wide millimeter of just a millimeter of a wide millimeter of just a millimeter of a wide millimeter of a wide millimeter
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> and <unk> pack on this bottle, how do you get those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in camera.
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a stack of photons which starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside.
At that time, waves travel through the table, and because of the reflections of the top of the top of the top you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that some of the insights will <unk>
Now, if we take a common and common bullet and we make them look at the same distance and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much people think it would lead us to see that movie?
One day? It's a week?
It would be a very boring film -- a slow <unk>
And what about trying to test with nature, <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> composition
But if you look at a more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> out of the tomato <unk> <unk> don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces off its interior and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in their mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at <unk>
Like photographers you know, if we took a picture to the low exposure, it goes very little light in.
But we'll go to a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I just get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data on raw data and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, actually.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to look after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You will go into the room, a piece is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
So we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera -- but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities in it.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to how a distance.
When you project projecting a laser picture, which you see on the screen, it really doesn't make sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, we get them, and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we be able to see it in scale.
This is our reconstruction for us.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what's on the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
Just like Doc <unk> himself a scientist, I became a science of arts and <unk> art.
And I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect every time are not just for visualizations but we can be able to be able to be able to make scientific visualizations but we can do it.
So creating a new form of computational photography with a slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> per second.
But here is something that happens.
If we look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost the speed of light, we have weird effects. And Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events in the world sometimes come up with the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can change life, and gives you individual freedom to you.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, and you can make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering to be searching for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would you have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot of all of you today have a cell phone.
But today I talk about my cell phone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
data.
Why is that information that data is.
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider all over Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends out a text to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, <unk> priests, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk>
<unk> was the secret police from East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone phone, <unk> <unk> who at that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, who can please get rid of all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't have a concrete answer. It was all blah blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we don't give you this information.
At the end of it, I agree.
I would take demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> on a CD in it.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and 5,000 pounds of information.
And I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public <unk>
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open came up with this stuff.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom out and go out, go back and forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I'm going on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call each other, and the other one, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicates to each other what time they call each other, what time do you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and for two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets in the streets in 1989, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if <unk> had known what the leaders were never would have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never had happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of going through our lives, and they want to take them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight that every day.
When they come home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and it's not <unk>
When you go home to your representative that just because business and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind them to remember they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why I get all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not an inspirational source -- and I don't want any of you in this point.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas Day, Christmas, are in the shopping center, drive in circles and looking for parking tickets.
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is one of them.
There is no <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am <unk> Muslim and woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same run.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in no time.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters. More <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and they got rid of that I was also out there, and if I didn't get all the <unk> all there was the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk in the age of five to me in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I take in was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten -- he was walking like a boxer teacher who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign slogan <unk>
The people who grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of people dying of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so <unk> of dawn at dusk is very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine to Palestine -- all the <unk> we would get <unk> in <unk>
On summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> and I was wearing warm cups on my back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I remember <unk> <unk>
But the college cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a <unk> comedian that couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can hold it in your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital, <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the State of the State of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks at least smart, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the crystal of <unk> my professors <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow to Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> in order to have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it at the end of it. At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying myself crying as if someone had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that she could not make the scenes of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't make the stunts stunts you can't do the <unk>
It was a role in which he literally had been born and gave an actor.
college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for disabled actors.
By <unk> I came home, and my first tour <unk> was an extra thing as an extra person in a <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> don't have <unk> actors, and not white, with disabilities.
You just ask perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took this famous book from New York to New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedy that led when she fell at the realization that I was at high speed on the New Jersey freeway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find ourselves very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival of New York, now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and at the time to remind the directors of <unk> and Arabs are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program <unk> it has a matter of Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, and I went to a study and sat there in a <unk>
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the desk of the fellow to not come out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just got to <unk> and hit my chair.
A lot of fun that I learned in direct <unk> is that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never get rid of me or no older ones.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I saw online clips as a comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What do you have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual as a race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said no, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media media, I don't think <unk>
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My cousin journey has led me to places.
I came up with <unk> by the red carpet, by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee children, a tiny fraction of what my parents would do?"
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know her story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small people on poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
No nothing for him, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities -- there are no work, not work, in the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year ago -- nothing.
One day he gets about a man who offered him to take him back to dinner after dinner, and <unk>
They brought into a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, to send home to your family.
They present to a young man.
They finally house.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That child from that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little boy trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing to arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
<unk> is often the youth that suffer from higher unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the history of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence -- to be the history of cities.
And in my hometown, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, "Well, if I never had gone?
And if I was forced to be forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to bring a few juvenile leaders at a business level.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders who are born.
And we sat down and we had some rain of ideas on the solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because because I was a graduate graduate student, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to reach from point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest for <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and their dream is sometime to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this different story.
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the spirit spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of economic opportunities who are looking so hot.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until it was a little bit, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies and now working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young families, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow <unk> because he uses a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought to work for an effort to work for government, but their story, their innovation really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
It encouraged us to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
At the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> corporate solutions for local problems.
So, we inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit, is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in development and put it in their business.
<unk> to the young people with the resources that they need to do, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and you'll create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park that's how it is called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent to rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their frugal innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains <unk> a <unk> area in the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
<unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be because of the road we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to make that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> aluminum <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy like to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where you <unk> the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> our trash, and the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of product <unk> every day.
I wanted to know the individuals as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through the road, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go better.
So I started working as a <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. And I <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming up and entering the traffic all day and spread around you.
You just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And also the trash in itself is full of dangers that are often falling from the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the <unk> of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is as a force of nature itself.
They never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It's always to be in motion.
And also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe I believe that the waste waste is the most important workforce in the city streets, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective way every day, this starts to protect them from their <unk> and their dangers inherent will threaten us in very real ways.
Control that we had controlled for decades and centuries they start <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out his relationship.
And then there's what I call our average <unk> necessary.
I mean by simply the speed that they used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't have any <unk> and we cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our bottle of water.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a work force on the other side that you know, about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about collecting waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> into that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us safely from ourselves, of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard a <unk> truck on the street, he grabbed my little son and dropped the stairs and there was a man doing his bike journey of paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste collection and I went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The municipal waste what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and in their lives, the next one you see somebody whose job is to clean the garbage from you, take a moment to get it out.
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought today two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as a example, to my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the cladding of crystals generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because this is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And thirdly, what he looks like has nothing to do with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> it's a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this free air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, well, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building modern building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the <unk> the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not yet.
And it's also among two street streets that don't communicate on an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries from the building.
And this extends out with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space of free air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that will fit the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the input of the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from the dresses of the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model it.
We're building that with these little <unk> parts, which are the windows that let go through the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what we <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the mall because in order to end up there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic, not just because of the material compared to glass, but because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is <unk> almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we thought about the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which they collect water from the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I have designed, it needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets in existing and creating 12 initial building blocks and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points with the idea of the interconnected doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small project of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural nature.
So we <unk> a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for them.
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a greater density at the upper levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community the whole space of the <unk>
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and do these things like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of people changes local communities and economies at the same rate as they grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as well to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright amounts of hair, very bright amounts of hair, and a little bit of <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the very good states, <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the way out of the school. I was a little afternoon and I hid in the bathroom <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took the table of my teacher to the grades.
And then I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a bit, just a little bit, just a little bit.
All the ones --  And I set back to the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other classmates had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> you'll find the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of rows from <unk> and myself a row -- it's just going to be there, because I was there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never get sick.
It's that it was all <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I'm going to tell me that the reason I know this <unk> so small, it was so good for <unk>
Do you get jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer jealousy.
Also the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the <unk> or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory where we study them in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> it would have no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I put my high school lists. Because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost that has all of them.
This year is about 100 years of his play, "In the <unk> time, <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of course, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about the <unk> that it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as a cat.
I don't know how the cat is <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> which are <unk> to the person to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when you feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being an storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to do, to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> makes us all <unk> and that's something that I was able to understand.
Everything that she makes to give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in your private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like great amounts of hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
This is why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover, then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us look like <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for the truth, really painful -- the more painful the truth, the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do with, which makes us suffer, causes a lot more profound and vital feelings that a wise man that can be <unk>
We're telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open ourselves in this particular way.
There is some other excitement to us, our <unk> our awful ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look with so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife will <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels describe very well how <unk> makes us look in intensity but <unk>
In fact, the most intensely <unk> we are, the more we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to make violent acts or illegal acts of this.
<unk> lead us to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking about me when I was eight years old, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which they would send up <unk> <unk> to itself, for one year.
For one year, a year.
She was trying to <unk> his new girlfriend from his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What's massive, even though we <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like an Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to how the <unk> break our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or wanting what you have to get to the <unk> of what you ever get, and it's under the floor -- your name, takes your <unk> cow <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I used to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live on jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not secure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been saying, <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once you <unk> in, <unk> all over the solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are on the same side.
Suddenly, you can admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> really are a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can stick with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Only fiction on jealousy.
The fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what we <unk> sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July, Buzz Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo minister of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and goat were alone, but his presence in the surface of the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the highest held for peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of day today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk>
But before the Apollo <unk> program 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on the surface, which sticks behind death row last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk>
Why turn it in our target?
And you could also ask, why can we climb the <unk> mountain.
So 35 years ago, why would you fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they are simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They went because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the airplane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship with candle, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo <unk> flew for 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the power optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that the problems we imagine that technology would solve how to go to Mars, to create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population, seem to have <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the dopamine tube, the rocket Saturn V.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars.
So that "Something's on our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have found us, and they had enriched toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't understand the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years where they were <unk> and Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offers to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas that are <unk> by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly is going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point of risk without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, tiny investments that they could leave in 10 years.
<unk> have always been struggling to invest with a benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development of development in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to don't solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars on Mars to be a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global consumption of energy comes from sources of renewables like the solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at price don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties will develop the development of <unk> energy -- to provide a significant increase in the research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know it for a long time that famines are a result of failure on the food shift.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and food food route, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the real problem.
President Nixon declared war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found out that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years they seem to have been found and effective and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can have and -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population should want to solve the problem, because the institutions should support the <unk> it should really be a problem with <unk> and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it fits with those criteria.
But it's a model that is <unk> in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and the dangerous, and there's not a science mythology of science fiction as the way of exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was only three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They are so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a big decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to talk about today is a different story about a <unk> a target and task, that I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It means me to think that it may have gone down in some activity or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have any sure.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to inspiring the same mistrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But this is that enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you look at are the generic attitudes that people manifests themselves when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would ask you to get you in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I'll probably be able to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust a few other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the confidence in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel like a kind of <unk> <unk> or a guy -- it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I may, for example, saying I trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why are we going to leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I believe that surveys are really bad tools to measure the real real confidence level because they try to get the good inherent judgment to the fact that they can trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's stupid.
It's not that goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what's <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> not to rely on what's not reliable.
And I think that those people who have <unk> their savings with very rightly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it -- he says, yes, OK, that means that what matters is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is make a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is competent in the commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in the contrary, they are not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I don't want to get a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are really sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I can take your own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is that, I still haven't been surprised.
But that's what we are <unk> to <unk>
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and others, that make us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> which is worth <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we call them <unk> as we say.
You must all know some similar examples.
<unk> all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were to be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we are reliable and if they were trying to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
And so we went to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in the end, is defining because we pin other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it, usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring some sense of evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes it every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple example.
The store where my socks says I can go back them without going to make a explanations for.
I take them and get me the money, or I get the money down the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're looking at is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of the computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
So I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that will be <unk> in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool they break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill <unk>
In the division of Sciences <unk> of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a working digital area.
You get a transparent transparent bombsight with cameras deep down to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, to get inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files, you have a location in real space -- it's as easy as a <unk> grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and put it out lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and thought about the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> for the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of looking at pixels in space, how can we make it physical so that we can make them <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical dish.
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And when we program the object, the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and stay in forever in the physical world.
You can teach them physically <unk> and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us with us with our world <unk>
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that remains our imagination.
Thank you.
I became <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes to athletes up with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only an effective path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera of China.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and he had a radio show.
But any adult asked the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I was just my friends, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
We went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what the first books I read here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
<unk> Good about life <unk>
And it's not a <unk> convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but <unk>
That's one thing for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet a new culture also gave place to my reading habit <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers scholars a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if I read comparative reading for research, why not do it as well on everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
They may be about people who were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic policies and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of missing in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I would be feeling or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream really is nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that storytelling is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, of where the passion, the passion, where happiness.
Until a dream <unk> I can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a graduate student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> threw himself on the couch in my office took off his shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories, that Alex brought the <unk> it became easy to move the head while we get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> who was saying, Alex, and so I looked at it, she was right.
You start to work after, get home later, they have children later, to death passes later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time of <unk>
But shortly after, my squad <unk> invited me to press Alex and talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe they fall down with the next one.
In addition, the best time to work on marriage marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and it had real implication of not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that nobody comes to age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take a dream out of sleep -- I want to see. All right. <unk> <unk>
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that give you a life that you would have happened to get 30 and <unk>
People of more of 40, don't trained to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future future 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and it <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> over their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person to that person the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens to be absolutely nothing.
And then every day every day, <unk> really interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then he starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then he starts to sound like this: "My quotes for the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, and then at some point around the 30, it turned the music and everybody started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so sometimes I think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a bit of a bit of -- but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the '30s and so many of the starting a career, to choose a city, to choose a city, to choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much longer time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's a research that starts to show, which is a lot harder and stressful doing all of the <unk>
The middle <unk> crisis is not about buying cars.
It's about giving you that you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you could not still decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As I was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living very hard <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
It would be often in our <unk> but then it was getting up to say, "One doesn't choose your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head over his legs and cry for almost all the hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was watching the empty space that follows after the words -- <unk> -- please call <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of hard work -- and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really gets <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the next decade of Emma was going on.
So for the next few weeks, and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who will spread from that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital capital generates an identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> the exploration of exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which, by the way, it's not exploration, which, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to get you to the airport, but the <unk> who get together with friends with similar minds are limited -- as you know who you think about how they think about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from its closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak friends from friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or no work.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the way we ran into this group.
Half the jobs that created never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is how you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
On the last but not least, Emma believed that you didn't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family when he has a couple and it exists his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit down than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or are <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you do, and that involves being so <unk> in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to do it to work or kill time with whoever you <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate on a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That supply supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
I had his new career, love her new family, and I sent a letter that said, "Now emergency community spaces are not good enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes coming out from Los Angeles, which go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> who heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I have the privilege to say to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, using identity capital, using your family.
You won't define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management consulting for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to graduate students in the public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, <unk> testing and tests.
Let me do homework.
When I work on, I went to grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some people who had a better performance didn't have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in seventh grade in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was really convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the West Academy and the West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, which is what teachers still will be teaching for the end of the school year and to figure out who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who will make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it arose a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was the purpose.
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only a week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly greater likely to get more likely to get more likely to be even more likely to get them into each other than I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> in which purpose.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how little people know about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop your determination for kids?
What should I do to teach kids a smart job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that the talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, behavioral determination is not related or is even related to the talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they die, because they don't think that there is a permanent condition.
So the mindset growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I end my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to fail, to start all over again with the lessons that will begin with.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese character.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese can be useful.
Since I was five, I started to learn how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and straightforward.
A Chinese academic, <unk> <unk>
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature enough enough to read signals, <unk> <unk> understand the basic idea of the web pages.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if it was shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> the way it's called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West.
I call this eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are two are a crowd.
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying to be <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a man-made Japan, in the whale.
A tree is two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations there.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> -- remember, because a tree speaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two two together, it gets too hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
You had somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, be careful about <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the <unk> we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is to the east of China.
So a sun next to that, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two sets up one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a date.
A mouth that tells you to come out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a brilliant excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and take a magic.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary to be remarkable.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial <unk> of child show.
However, the magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took off 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy, and a <unk> boy would <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence on the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician can do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
Do you use magical shoes to defeat the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the <unk> <unk> is that the most amazing characters and wisdom and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had been <unk>  So it remained in the room and was very impressed as a mom with her <unk> in the behind, and I don't think he would understand what he was going on, but, look, <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke had an army to <unk> the government?
Do you find this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win Dorothy his movie?
To do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with -- OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital F, force into the movies for our children, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in the girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that I would have served to navigate through the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really expected the credit to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, <unk>
Why do they keep there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, from Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they were kids, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful subject of all time continues to come up with a classic <unk> in classic after a child of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and a man and two men who are <unk> a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's pretty good. Don't let it get the <unk>
Well, almost no one of these movies happens to test it.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> In the movie, there's more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to turn the requirement.
These women speak each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the boy than you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie -- <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success from <unk> a sense of consensus from what is a <unk> movie movie film.
<unk> don't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie is happening in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and this is the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door, and say, <unk> to the bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular movies -- how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a number more than this one that is going to spread this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what it would say.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's a massive entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is defeat <unk> and then they charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is changing radically.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite "Star <unk> favorite Star "Star <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to protect their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell me to my <unk> Go and fight and fight only and more stories where their work looked like to join a team, perhaps a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better than the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look out of sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I got to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length.
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And instead of the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape of the landscape of building materials and the activities of ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find a <unk> city called <unk> -- lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period in a time period called the Roman Empire.
The place stands in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> always have known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I will try to find it at the point that you would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this kind of elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> occupation of several hundred years to date back from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry jewelry, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that comes from the Middle Roman <unk>
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry, which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would turn to the place in the near future to <unk>
And most importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire, probably was written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to the TED -- TED wasn't founded in 1984 ago.
Do that the ideas actually occurred in 1984 B.C. in a lost city, not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, versus the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that is made.
Now we <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing in a bike bike career and go back to the front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their home.
There are bicycles flying around the <unk> wheels that go on to your side, the rays of the wheels that end up in the room -- <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
It was in the lobby, or what the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
It's a brown horse.
It's a horse that's talking about.
You can feel your blue blue fur, your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go into a <unk> in the mouth.
They slept on one side and training their living room.
In the room, and doing the peak of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's a little bit of laundry dancing on his middle center, singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now I went to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a kind of yellow bricks and from the oven. They come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and by Len in "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar peculiar contest that is driving every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
They looked at the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people have to be a phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a guy named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the better memories of <unk>
And I said, "Well, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition is saying they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old techniques invented by two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and the medieval academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction is, <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English thing, even though a little <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live in national TV.
That would prove the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to be the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a lot of treaties on the memory of thinking about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> memory <unk> and it wasn't as rare as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people put in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible for our modern world, but they also have changed.
We have changed to us, and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet in where you still find people passionate about this idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> and resilient this competition as unique of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to be able to be able to be able to have brains in a way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a <unk> MRI machine, your brains as they collect numbers, numbers, faces and shapes of snow. They found that in the memory champions they found that in memory champions you get rid of the brain, different to others.
It actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as a race armed race where each year comes out with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should be put in a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the right order of <unk> binary binary <unk>
<unk> Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the potential techniques at the end of the end that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It turns out with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I say two people who remember the same word. And I tell you to you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's her name.
And then I ask you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word that I told you a <unk>
What do you get?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said that their work is <unk>
The same word, different than <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that they dance in their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in your hands.
It's good when they come home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story goes like this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had a hired like entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get it to a <unk> he would get to a poet.
He stood up <unk> his memory poem, and he got <unk> and so soon it was, the hall was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed all of them, but it shattered the body <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So they wouldn't be able to get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing out, and the only survivor, in the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the family of my hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions that word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial spatial memories.
If you were to tell me that I was the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you were to tell you who I was sitting on the horse lying in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and proteins with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it out of the memory of the same way that I would have done it <unk> if you had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous and <unk> image to help you remember that the first thing you want to talk about, is that completely competition.
And then you can imagine if you can imagine entering his house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then I put in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a year year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for word -- which is going to be confused but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase "In first <unk> would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got up with it full of that.
I went to some of these memory and I had the idea of writing something grand about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
And seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting in <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before I sit to the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school kid bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never expect it to do that.
It was fun, because it wasn't just training the memory.
What it is actually about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape, just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory memory.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I'd covered a year before. He had the idea that I could enter into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work work.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> of <unk> to benefit from a little <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift to <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> indeed.
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes a kind of deep processing kind of processing that most of you are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks along to our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even want to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person remember <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we would just take a place that was <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from connecting me I was six years old, and lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there you all spent the time watching television. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone was seen by me and I would go back and come back into a towel and I would all see me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
I hated that tour, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, nor <unk> division of areas -- emotional connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you're interested in, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it, by based on a building that is built two thousand years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> it has this round thing, columns red, and they leave red, which is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the human values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, the one was another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly making new technologies, new new solutions for life forms today.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so far away from the people.
All of the black, you think that we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and get back to these symbols <unk>
So we do, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start experimenting with <unk> we do swing the next to go ahead and go ahead and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We put the next one in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we become a <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
One.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies of it.
These fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian or Italian one.
And maybe with an endless little sticks of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started doing the next one in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with called <unk>
We put the symbols right now -- we now have new R&D techniques in the computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> some forms that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, the building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical scholars and public generally agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> is building <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up to a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Seattle, in Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and he was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical, how it is possible to become ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened -- because the media gets <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new development happened with another star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened to these very few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all the architecture. The digital media began to increase the speed of information.
Think about it, for example, how the architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
The technology <unk> You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the communications speed of communications has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is so quick.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
You need a long time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more than knowing if that I designed four years ago, was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
<unk> was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or a steel or the sun revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the <unk> of communication, it starts to swing faster and faster, until we're going to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and they will actually be <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and the audience -- and the public.
Now we can make almost <unk> symbols of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a middle of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experiment, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there is no only answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and drawings and complicated, and you're not a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listening, and you don't leave them through the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick based on ideas of what was a <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage park in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> East <unk> and raise half a million dollars of the community around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we've built.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> smarter and more <unk>
We've been waiting for everybody to you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it to the most <unk> spaces in local libraries of local libraries and households where we form our kids, and the step of the bedroom in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it this wonderful way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. And I got to think, "When do I couple doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people look at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, they just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
As his mom tells him and what his friends or school classmates said, "You don't know who believe.
So a video ago, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, which gets these answers into one of the stages of their lives more vulnerable vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as a young way.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of things that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is <unk>
What is the greatest thing in the life of somebody in front of what it's normal in a daily context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls right now.
<unk> <unk> zero of our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the sport, the concert of the sport, and the singers in the <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow and be healthy individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort to look at its appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical ability, their studies and other aspects are starting to be hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer to not do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as we move to society and to the developing field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates in class.
One in five are not attending at all during the days when you're not comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think that you do good enough, it specifically if you don't think you're nice enough, you can get a lower note at the average of your fellow people who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it comes out regardless of what these young people do.
So, to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The lower self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem is less physical activity, they eat fewer fruit and vegetables, engaging in more diets that they can bring to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all over this because of what they make more decisions like consumer consumption and drug consumption and <unk> violence, aesthetic sexual activity, and no protection and damage damage.
The perfect body is pushing into the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women are not present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think about what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is interest in each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three keys. The first is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that many <unk> programs without knowing it, <unk> the situation.
So we should make sure that the program that our children follow not only a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be able to be able to provide an education in terms of body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the differences in the subject and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
To defy the current status of the way women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution from our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not because they see them.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the type of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to value all their own person, valuing diversity, diversity,
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
If you make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never seeing the ones that are who are who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are you in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk> Your <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is on two seats away. What would it mean for her if he released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> a more flat, <unk> feet, a <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were to <unk> this and would give its potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk>
But we would make our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because they make us feel.
They get to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's switch each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we worked together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age today, become safe agents of self tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and he killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
They were initially guilty, but being a prisoner for other charges in the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans was taken by an FBI <unk> for an FBI.
Sadly, the <unk> bomb, in the World Trade Center, couldn't be able to do.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving American mother, elementary school, the two did all the potential for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
By experience I saw that when people take time for <unk> you don't need a lot to want the same things in life.
However, in all of the human group, in every human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that you think we have to use all possible means that they all lived like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last few weekends, he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice in practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to <unk> by shooting <unk> that, without knowing our group, was adopted by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he said, I gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise everyone, especially from me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
From such father, as a child.
All of all, the comment gives you a lot of laugh, but only a few years later I understood what they thought to them so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the North Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved on 20 times, that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was given time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class I often was <unk>
It secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the <unk> quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons they didn't develop social skills, to say that <unk> for growing <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
And I realized, and I would judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put my thinking to test my thinking about it was during presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Geographic Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had made friendship, was Jewish age.
It took several days out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to beat the barrier that all life was made to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
Every life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all of the <unk> were bad <unk>
By I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people <unk> exactly how I would have wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I was taught as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that was a homosexual but I know what is being tested for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart made me become honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure that I was desperately <unk>
And on occasion, inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my own life that my own father, <unk> was not in no avail.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she said to me something that conserving my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope someone, one day, who is trying to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way. That even though I joined this violent ideology.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those acts of <unk> acts as rejection to the actions of my father.
With this simply, I'm here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is project in their minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood who project in front of your eyes.
And it is constantly a voice superimposed on your human thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths to be human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, tea, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know that I have an <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is the reason to live.
If you weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is an objective of nature.
<unk> by nature, is subjective in it.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, it would take that vision.
<unk> studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience of studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or sense of pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is answering some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are doing with it.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
There are no easy problems with consciousness.
It's not addressing the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk> film, why is there a <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they operate <unk> how <unk> are <unk> they adapt to adapt and <unk> living organisms.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about, how we talk about, how we are playing, which are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why all of the behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, is actually still not much to say.
I am a <unk>
I want a scientific theory, that it works for a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in real terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that was not working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a <unk> chain of concept, awesome. We get used to this -- physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of crazy, goodness, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the inner inner movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies all it needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want a theory of purely purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
It was fundamental laws that are <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental properties and properties are not explaining in terms of any more basic things.
Instead, they look at fundamental words, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- <unk> <unk> laws of Newton. So applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain awareness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- space, time, load, then for some matter of logic, you have to add the <unk>
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness itself as something fundamental -- a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science, right?
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that govern consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass of time, the <unk>
The physicists sometimes say that we want the fundamental laws that we can take them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws as simple as we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This view is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is aware, not only humans, the dogs, the mice -- even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when he thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> to make some of the early precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so crazy?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more about a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason it comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that are <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, <unk> awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple consciousness, right?
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a level of information integration information, just a significant degree of consciousness fairly important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there's still a different level of zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
<unk> the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies the reality behind it.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming out of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be <unk> but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire at the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I wasn't supposed to eat anything that had consciousness, so I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to be very well, this tends to transform your vision, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact that the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has a complicated processing processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have very serious ethical problems on the development of development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of collective collective and the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a local level, a group integrated like the audience at a TED Talk, right now we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical idea, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm really sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is something fundamental -- than the second is universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the complex kind of awareness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we will finally come to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile -- an area of education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a <unk> for a community award for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a obvious problem.
She actually hasn't got anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater profile on my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yes. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching high school in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the <unk> law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on chairs of wheels, they talk about things <unk> at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And so when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people as an inspiration.
And we don't know, and it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire me.
And in fact, I am on this stage and what I do in this wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not standing here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they've been sold to be the lie that disability is something to be <unk> A capital expands.
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes it remarkable.
It's not bad and does not make it <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before you <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without drawing a drawing with a pencil holding out the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with <unk> <unk> legs.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we would go to a group of people for the benefit of the other group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled disabled of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and thinking, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I got to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
So these images, those images are <unk> to people with disabled people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's do some things.
But the things that we <unk> are not the things you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called <unk> social model that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm really excited about it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that the disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here to take the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by <unk>
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> other people with disability all over time.
However, I don't know that I'm rather fortunate than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over --  <unk> the clever trick of how to carry your phone battery into the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really think that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a stretch of stairs has not made it to become a <unk>
Never.   Get up to a TV screen, I'm not going to show you the subtitles for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching the <unk> <unk> not considered to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be able to get away from the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and football -- with the <unk>
What is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, I just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about reality <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but reality reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the reality of <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional focus on the field.
Right now, the only way that I will be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds were <unk> trying to deal with it all its being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I took a few videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the hull, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a submarine coming up on the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a little bit of a moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that there are no people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be your favorite players and asked me on YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus never created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Go.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man on a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will the experience of a fan
When I could be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing it in <unk>
What will your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win.
So here's a brief refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to their field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then on their defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see the next move you are shown in front of you, in a plastic <unk> <unk> <unk> you don't have to worry about being a <unk>
You know, the strategy.
They just go out of the field, and they react.
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose matches as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you look at it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
You can have information <unk>
This is going to make good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being just <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would <unk>
What would it be in the country?
Imagine you're the field <unk>
He <unk> the ball and <unk>
We went to an open limb. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- let me tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
You go to the protection.
Another <unk> gives you a open seat.
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees on its bombsight an area of grass that lights and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> public and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something to create massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to try and lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use only as a bread and <unk> as our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenue per year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently joined me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the country <unk> the south end of the county of County <unk> that includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and their architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who was able to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is almost <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a <unk> four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is broken bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most people die on the impact.
The ones that no, normally they fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this <unk> method will realize the death of death to which they were <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get in the before of their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman was talking to an officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successful that day in bringing it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
Are you trying to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but also the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, official officials and psychologists train the new government today.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July 22 last year by receiving a call from a possible suicide bomber sitting in the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a official of the Golden Gate player.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here twice before from New Jersey to try to kill him from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story about the <unk> box.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She was left <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on on the right, and he left.
This kind of smart guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing too well, because the next day, the family of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason were doing it.
<unk> damage damage to a lot of people.
I ask you to ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it <unk>
What do you do?
How to say that?
In my experience, you just have to talk about, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't fear <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, do you have similar circumstances have thought about ending their life -- you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save life and being the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son in January 19, and he wrote this email only a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this week.
I just wanted you to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty disappointed but noticing more times to realize that Mike doesn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the game of 49 with his father in January.
He never came there.
I called the police police and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the bridge that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March September of 2005, I wrote a radio call by a possible subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
<unk> my motorcycle motorcycle and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, they immediately cross the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next and a half hour, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account to go back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came up, he <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did to <unk> and give the hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I'm <unk>
I stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events on the 11th of 11th and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
I think that Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
It was inspired by Kevin when only six months were completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
<unk> debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she write, <unk> when I visited the General San Francisco Hospital in San Francisco that night, you take them as the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father, and the active member of the society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story to inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was killed by poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, I gave me the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Usually this is just achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved with -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And for that time, I would take my hand up at three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those who have jumped out of the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who left the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that all of us and every one of us should be able to get them to do.
<unk> you can prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but inside your interior you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you get in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever been a little girl.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my myself.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just getting started.
All of us <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin <unk> or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo -- which is considered to <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent may even ignored my story.
I think this <unk> is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded by the way I was born because of the appearance of my genital <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom was wondering, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair. I'm a <unk>
And I knew how to do that.
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery again.
Because of my success, I never helped me to share my story, not because he would think that being a bad thing, but because of how the world is about to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have a mama, dad and a family who will accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess of <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was born, she got rid of the <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won on <unk> I won <unk> and he was a third finalist among over 40 candidate among over 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when we went to remote <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that they passed my statement to the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you <unk> the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also joined me when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand to do the most sophisticated, sophisticated surgeries and secure.
So in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license.
It was a great time.
For some people, their computer paper means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt like I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York <unk> who was living his truth, but that, <unk> put her alive.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All about 20 of the course of November we do a global waking for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are George P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my true truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 of them <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you to thank all of my <unk>
In my network of support, my parents especially, my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young <unk> who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called and told me that his parents couldn't take it, I would take my mom and he would call my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. Other people don't. It's just about gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that race <unk> <unk> and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. All right. <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies, the parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when their efforts were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very popular a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in hunter-gatherer societies right from the beginning, when when you're born a girl, his birth won't be <unk>
It's not welcome, not because of her father, nor for her mother.
The neighborhood goes, gives her to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother <unk> but the daughter. The daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, he stays at home and the school admits of her brothers.
Up until the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes in adolescence, when it was 13 years old, you allow him to come out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the call of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family, and if you <unk> the code of that honor, honor, the might even kill.
And it's interesting that this definitely code code, not only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of the male family members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of their life and happiness of their sisters on behalf of the course.
And there's a more norm of the <unk> societies that's called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who has to be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embracing people's decisions and her mother and mother and decisions from the <unk> even if you don't will.
If you put it up with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle goes on and continues.
And I was eating brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborn <unk> to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I went on, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and he grabbed my pen, and I got a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old and a half and a half years old, I was sitting in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One classroom to school means that has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of <unk> <unk> and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in no document.
That's why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
He taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They had brothers and sisters, supported by more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all the political, social and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
They were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers who were killed.
<unk> billion, but a few <unk> and I was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and lifted up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, offered her same for the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the ninth of October 2012, he shot him on the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read to my wife to my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
We have the right cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of the truth, because of the peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right road, and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital and she had gotten severe pains and strong headaches from head because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow coming out of my wife.
But my daughter is never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with my face.
I'm okay. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
And we had brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite the rights of children and women's rights, it's like any 16 years old.
<unk> when he didn't have his homework.
She fights her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's particularly in my mentoring which has made so audacious to <unk> so audacious and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm a engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined me in the Google <unk> group where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> But all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before you join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation
You are still being smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything else, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix them out of chemicals, and try to convince them to stay alive.
Over once I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that we would try to get the dose to try to get the <unk> doses because there really doesn't exist a clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to test with different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the doses changed dramatically -- my <unk> my sense of who I was like, my thinking to me, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and chemical chemicals for a comic man, and I was surprised by looking at how my thinking changed.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out to be an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that I had to the front of it, and it just wasn't going to happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to take care of, since then I carry better with men.
What I was trying to do about to do is adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and others, and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my ideas of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point -- how do you do those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> and new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in similar ways.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are the ones today -- and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, which is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really, really <unk> sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were made by two major groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used technology imaging -- functional MRI, to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you get away, looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created by <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image, and imagine looking at that same picture.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains in order to create a great pool of brain reactions to the video clip.
And then they showed them a film with new, new people, new animals, and as much as we have a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information of the scanning of scanning -- to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're close to doing that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the largest brain scanning systems that are available today, and its resolution is a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and you can introduce electrodes.
I don't give me that.
Many are proposing new projection techniques by images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way of getting greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> they just offer small improvements in the resolution, not for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI was to make these very big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent developments in <unk> of clever and bright solutions on <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and radio receivers can radio radio <unk>
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, we prescribe magnetic patterns -- magnetic patterns -- <unk> to radio frequencies ...
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing processing -- we can increase <unk> information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few options more than opening up this door.
However, you pick one year, to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it takes a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just of the guidance.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet, maybe it is to say to some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever lived in life.
So I all come up with a tough conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
He's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side of the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- not <unk> my armpits, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I will be slope from the <unk> of my pants and I cut my head up, my head was a little bit, I would ask myself usually a child, "Hey, you are a kid or <unk>
And there'd be uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother <unk> a cold cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling of it.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
So this hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was ready and I was about to go into the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> quotes <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues,"
So I took a deep breath, and I went down and I went down and my backs and my backs of four years with a pink dress with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> a little girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
So I took it too much -- again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a kind of <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and I saw clothes of boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to wear a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a pink <unk> and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
I am more of a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me paying attention, and he said, "My favorite god is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all of it, just "Ah, <unk> you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest thing that I ever ever had.
And because of <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were putting one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color the walls are.
You just know how a feeling feels like in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you 100 reasons why to come out of my closet it was harder to go out of their own, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has declared them in bank banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I'm telling you is harder to tell your son of five years that you're going to get to you.
There's no more difficult, there's only a tough thing.
We have to stop classifying what is difficult to do about what it is difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made -- it's not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail a dress and <unk> shoes tall.
It wasn't the lesbian <unk> <unk> to fight any four years to walk into the coffee.
I was frozen in fear, I was in one corner of my dark closet -- my <unk> gay, and the moving only one muscle is the most scary thing I ever have.
My family, my full strangers I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around on purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister <unk>
It was the first time that many of the guests were invited to know that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> and my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and I finally got to one where the friends were my parents, people who knew myself to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women were <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had started.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and it's never talked about having <unk>
What is your TV TV show.
Our <unk> program will Will and Grace and Grace show.
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting for desperately to show his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said <unk> "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to tell where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find it and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that we want.
That's how hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> You know? Be it.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other ones have to know that they also need to do.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, they <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can get injured safer -- so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So next time you find out in a dark closet -- a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen the intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think it's as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the computer pioneers like Alan intelligence.
And so, a few years ago, we would have a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that it's a <unk> race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of Earth and intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a only underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately immersed for development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that require the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in robotic planning, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to make complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, and I asked them for several years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open options with a touch force with the diversity of potential futures -- yeah, even an impending future, <unk>
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open choices.
And so, having to tell this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that make more mess, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior are not just correlated with production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long run, in any system where you meet in.
Amazingly, <unk> could be able to spend multiple animal intelligence testing, playing human intelligence games, and even making money to be <unk> actions, all of it without being done to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing in without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically by a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a finish line.
He simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for the <unk> robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling into opposite sides of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, in a variety of other fields.
<unk> widely applied to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully by playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we are looking at new connections to a social network where their friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps success on the net very connected.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications of health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense problems, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a series of successfully <unk> in a series of successfully <unk> assets under its exponentially.
This ability of risk management skill will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of smart human behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the robot, the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you were going to be smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion there.
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, have had all the concept of <unk> <unk> in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then they try to take over the world.
It's all right, that the urge to take control of all possible potential is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
I often ask me, how do you look for targets like this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the Age of stars, and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting around other stars, what points that Earth is only one between the billions of planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the intensity <unk> of the stars when the planets go over in front of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light to get to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their star star.
So in <unk> this helps us understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their <unk>
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of wealth of potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a science scientist and the weather, or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know better and our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though being a little farther from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that is demonstrated by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere -- and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these images -- they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty bad place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to have <unk> places with Mars.
Even in the most pristine places on the Earth, the air is cool and filled with oxygen by our tropical forests per thousand miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets are <unk> with a great and sad <unk> and the implication of some of the ones that Mars will expect there to save ourselves from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly <unk> Earth.
And so I like to think about this <unk> I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to apply to humanity is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the Earth is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They just find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and hostile areas of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an <unk> <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist, Enrico Fermi had to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations get advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that we are to protect the origin of planets that we're going to bring into this development.
It's <unk> to think that only the colonization we will be able to save us from ourselves, but the <unk> and <unk> exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put into the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I went to my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to get it cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight in Europe to the next morning, and I saw my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive but sure that you don't get more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, I was going to stopped.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate <unk> the adrenaline and <unk> and <unk>
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in your place, which would be made bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happens, you know, the probability of a total catastrophe happening.
So I started to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't survive.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who's the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked to him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called a retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it would take a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the tribes live in the <unk> and <unk> tribe.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys of the car and reading glasses.
So at home, you get a place for the keys, a hook alongside the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a drawer in particular.
For your <unk> you know, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with it that you will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card, a picture of his credit card card, passport, <unk> by email itself so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or the <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain release <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that <unk> will not be at the best time, and we have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face to a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all decision-making decisions and actually for decision-making decisions and social decisions -- any kind of choice you need to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have a result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even it's likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do is, a statistic that you must ask for the most doctors they don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have a surgery in any medical procedure before it helps a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor wouldn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not the doctor of the doctor, and if it's somebody <unk> it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the underlying mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs are only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, <unk> the <unk> effects, Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things that are going to be able to rely on muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they are now thinking, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, so I'll take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how you take this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that you can help your medicine.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you should have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> work is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I have launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that the most is done in the oldest men in the '50s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number needs to deal with it <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects of only a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before you ask the questions that you can make up the conversation forward.
You don't have what to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot longer to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can shift from opinion of the moment, but unless you are trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, doesn't react very quickly. You could get the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown this.
So we have to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail again.
The idea is to think about the future of how those <unk> are going to be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in Montreal when I returned from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination next to the door, with a key to the door door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of messages that I haven't read read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol for you.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, <unk> -- in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French sign was during the 1800s, and over the time, and over time, they mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language we know about as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country by following <unk> and <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand sound sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"You don't get the <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, not <unk> the covered in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm so <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about to come next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk>
They go on to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it be with my thumb -- so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and a lot of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now sound has gone into my territory of art.
Is it going to remind you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a tactile way, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me about the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could get it to me.
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if you didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the equal and become my voice.
That way I'm capable of being relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to maintain a temporary way of something like taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be involved in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be able to capture and express on paper.
And the same thing can say in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in many different <unk>
If you <unk> a different parameter for each finger while you play the piano, like facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while the piano, the piano, English is a linear language -- like if you get down the piano, English is a linear language.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in order to express a concept of clear or idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens to the music in terms of and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters we can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> sign of that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I'm <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and gets in.
This is all the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time at once.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of four times a <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk> in <unk>
Watch <unk> hand. <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in my head as my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one. Please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen on your head and your chest <unk> but they carry very different meanings out there.
It's amazing to see how <unk> are alive and thriving like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I'd like to just open your ears, open your eyes, open up in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would tell us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I got older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the other people.
The country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizens and invention at the American school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of crap.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts up with an eternity and it's very expensive and also too risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our little tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a <unk>
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> so that kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> children get a lot with robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we will transform light and web cameras on planar signals, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this picture, and measure the size of each <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody would hold it even further.
And the cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to try and fix it immediately.
I'm trying to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, you get to see the Internet, and you get rid of this image: too.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands of the world's largest world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and oil also are brown color, and when everything <unk> is very hard to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be made through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
And the cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help shape other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away -- maybe to tackle a harder problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it involves several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> all over the east coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant to Fukushima, a nuclear power plant near the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still <unk> of the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and most of them -- it has a good thing, and it looks sure, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research with some other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different nutrients.
It might seem like they didn't take the job seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all your life.
Together with them we discussed the data that gives you and talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And so we were able to notice that the radioactive powder was <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the nearest near nuclear power to date.
We zoom in up to a 1.5 miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of the <unk> so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, you can basically build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the elderly population to transforming their standard <unk> into new self-driving cars.
The plastic and oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the kids of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So American citizens, creators, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel parts, the other one of a single thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic thing.
One imposes on the environment, the other one I thought I thought about.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool by <unk>
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information for it for every cell to work and to make it <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made out of place, and they <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
You're acting primarily like filter the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through variation.
Here is a broken screen, which represents my view of the world that represents the personality of every designer and architect to work on between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, analysis and synthesis, shown in the two screens after me.
My job at the simplest level, is trying to bring these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 years ago, or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment in the history, a rare moment -- where four disciplines -- that offers designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through a large scale, like this robotic arm with a 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> basis that someday <unk> to print <unk> buildings and graphs at the nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> -- they're <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, which is <unk> in the flexible waist.
Along with a 3D printing collaborator of 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D <unk> between the cells. I will show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this very high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allows to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair to the comfortable structural thing, and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator became the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern, it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the points of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material.
But this is nature's nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them sat down and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends on the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So for that first tree, there was no difference between trunk, and branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects <unk>
Let's get a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material <unk> the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune your properties, we could generate <unk> structures.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We had a lot of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
So chemical <unk> we've been able to make a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the soft light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> controlled <unk>
The robot could vary the material properties over the march and create these structures made of a single three miles long, 100 percent recyclable <unk>
When the parts are ready, you dry it down to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria genetically engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition out of <unk> to <unk> and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for <unk> objects that are designed for <unk> in the sea, and <unk> life and placed in the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we made our own table table, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get sick.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help to help flow of these bacteria and make it <unk>
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the material properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, they will make more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to another another, 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our little intestine ...
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> bright channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the harm and <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer has a 3D printer to make stuff in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
manufacturing is not <unk> it's about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, is the glue or the <unk> putting those fibers together.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, they stick a small magnet on the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors -- and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the worm worm of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They're often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we saw these templates and we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They become <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that worms are <unk> to the dark areas and cool it is why we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, distributing the silk worms of the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> worms worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they were <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion and our integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which leads us to turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new design era of design, a new era of creation, that leads us from design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by a nature inspired by the first time, that we make us in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and websites, and then playing the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of boredom, this sense of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I'm going to get stuck in it, and I let me absorb and feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because it wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about it because of nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have a few years then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the culture was <unk>
So ask yourself, "What do you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was going to hire that age.
It's considered a naive question to trigger cute answers in the children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
This question is about again and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of the time before it takes us the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired to dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, you do right now, because when someone asks you what you might be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults will be <unk> maybe they would be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> publisher of a magazine converted to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you can hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the true vocation, the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and to devote your life to it.
But if you are somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so to say.
It could help if you divide it in three different <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms of the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance the ideal was who was okay with <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
I think it looks like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with an identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or woe you need to win.
But what I've learned about talking about people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in the way this way.
Here are three superpowers here.
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, and we were designing data and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewels <unk> <unk>
A <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of your background, can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> it <unk>
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child, he had an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer and a writer, I was an investment company.
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when their practices was beginning to write their practices and this ability to write compelling <unk> for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to be <unk> even if we finally get it to the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to transform anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other designer designer designer -- sometimes I paid from Kickstarter, sometimes <unk> and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be used to meet the market needs, the ones that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, which are <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They come up with the belly of the belly -- knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist, you can dive deep into practice, and the <unk> provides a span of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are happening with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, at the very large part of them are told to be more like your <unk> <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring is whatever.
If you are a <unk> so, you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just noticed one of them in the last 12 minutes, or --  I say, "Let's do with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important -- <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman called <unk> he took her to a psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a look and found strange and found strange and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising thing.
If we had been living today, we couldn't give her more aid than the <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from infections, many treatments for cancer, <unk> <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But recently, there's been progress on treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think of this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it'll affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, the chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one of each one of each other.
In other words, there is the probability that you go through their 20s with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or love with Alzheimer's.
In the U.S. alone, Alzheimer's dollars costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars for medical care spends the disease disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs to increase a rise of five times by 2050, as the generation of the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it has become relatively little <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's that of other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer research in spite of the fact that Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one cause more fundamental than lack of consciousness.
Because this is what days of people knows, but the whole world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, including scientists, confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy person's brain compared to an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by significantly reduce life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know today they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places that are <unk>
And when it <unk> well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules being <unk> between themselves, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step blocked is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You can do a wire I could do anything.
<unk> others can make the pump <unk>
You have to find the right step that is blocked and then create a drug that makes it happen.
Until recently, in his most part, they have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> <unk> engineers and mathematician.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. It's testing a new type of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when they test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that you stick with each other as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at the early stage, then we see it <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years on, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to tell you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we ignore it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 80s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too reluctant to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience, I test it myself as a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions for example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number three: When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
It <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like from him, or I know I know very honest for this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever known.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really detail really called me attention, the gadget two of the participants had married six months later, and invited to all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But we had a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent her to the body Love -- a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking yourself, they still keep up there?
And the reason I think is <unk> this is because I have done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just about what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had forced me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have a few thousands of view.
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as you had had no idea.
The article was released on Friday at night, and at the Saturday night, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the "Today Show and "Good Good <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million <unk> and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster confidence by writing -- on their own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an international media has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what every day every day for weeks, they always asked the same question: are still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were students and <unk> and strangers -- like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately made it red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times ran a <unk> article for San <unk> that included readers of readers when I test the study on them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very scared with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did to do a public emergence together.
And I went from TV, and he refused to <unk> photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel like at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really <unk> -- I mean, if I was able to produce love love, not only a adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, especially that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for interpersonal approach, among university students, using what he <unk> called <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds <unk> right?
But studying it it worked.
The participants were felt closer after they do multiple studies, they also used the technical protocol protocol as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used by the police and the community have used it among people in the opposite of the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately you never get <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> I tested the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you get rid of the person who you do it.
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better people after testing the research.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking at when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, which was supposed to practically all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I'm going to focus on science.
I did all of what I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could sort of read the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I was just designing for the book that I was writing -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I after.
But I can also see me most clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably they can demand me to me.
What I'm looking for of love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> but I'm going to remain <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story told you about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to somehow mitigate some of the risk, and this is a very controversial story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still still together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let me make you more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are you going to stay in love when things get together, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the question of your mate?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and we apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are still <unk> together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love with not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. Love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had no idea what that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't think I would have both of them to take that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always pick up or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone as happy and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think really.
And what we <unk> and what maybe my life is looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the ultimate ending implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't have.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
One of New York City ago.  Something that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he took a dollar note, a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from travel, and do all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> at the style Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and <unk> to them, so I added more <unk> on the canvas, thinking, I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to grow up size, as if it was <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did. I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, weird bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to get them back and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing like it is around a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, let's tell you that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of <unk> natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I got <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then another window, and another window, and it had all these windows together which make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very large -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by great measure in "The <unk> garden <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk>
It's <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, he's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures of animals have travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where the creatures of animals are heading to the <unk> ready to commit suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well on the ocean.
Anyway, also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand is coming out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological thing that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> meters of a snake that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire by <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go around -- you know.
Your tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made from 1986.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if you were baseball cards of the terrorists.
<unk> <unk>  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> you're called <unk>
This is a project of six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material whether or dictionaries or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of archive in the form of human being, and travel in <unk> groups, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide them.
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 billion pounds with a dead human inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is the <unk>
I'm going to show you all over the rest of the body, there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body game in half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are a little bit of pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue in the head.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician -- one writer, a <unk> a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We put out the box and all the people on it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter, and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
Take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the intestines and other organs.
So I'll take a pill that is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug that you have in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these children are going to reduce the amount of viruses in blood, and increase <unk> cells.
But they are also known by their side effects <unk> in its vast majority of negative, because in the time it takes it to be able to get to the current <unk> they get <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes it to get to its fate, which is where it's more important, in the HIV tank, of HIV.
These are regions of the body like <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily on the blood stream of patients who are tested to regulate therapy with drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life run by their own.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to make the virus directly to the pump of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the health care and surgery and diabetes surgery can be used for anything else -- including shipping drug transportation.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes that open and close holes, almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask yourself, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a powerful beam laser on the cell membrane living by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We are testing this technology in vitro or <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> at the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it runs to the website of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the form of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the <unk> researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups of armed groups like terrorists, insurgents like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not shooting 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and to study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation.
I do a field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors, non-governmental actors.
For example, from the <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had been signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one can see what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies not armed with <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just to fire.
They're multitasking form.
We would build a complex machinery of <unk> radio stations, radio channels and Internet websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the <unk> <unk> <unk> and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their <unk> increase their <unk> to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools in schools, run hospitals, they run professional or professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population of offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The Pakistani ascent of Taliban in Afghanistan <unk> by war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> <unk> for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, victory <unk> in 2006 of Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps in the government, and come up with armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the sophisticated things are these organizations, less and less we can behave like something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They put a part of a territory, and you run all its <unk> they collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, <unk> nations and hybrids and the weakest the states are in the Middle East and the more forth and they fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counteract these groups will have to invest more into the military tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups -- we understand better what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, not enterprises, military power can win some fights, but we don't give us peace and stability.
To get these targets we need long-term investments to fill that emptiness of security, to fill that gap from government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label tag would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I'm going to tell me as a bad feminist surface.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women -- these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they <unk> the sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world, and the anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> which might be a feminist.
Being labeled as feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and cannot imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and besides, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They have the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as <unk> or <unk>
We have a right to use it <unk> and accessible the contraceptives and the services of them.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for controls or <unk> <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social, social condition and so much more.
We have to have in account these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap rap -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends the classic <unk> classic <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely overwhelmed by my musical results.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> but also killing insects, the collection of garbage, the <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales, which are actually true.
Some of my offenses are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, is his husband, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, I agreed that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the gay and gay workers, and <unk> for white, white, <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist guy.
It also happens to be this: It feels a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it's going to be given to perfection.
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being <unk> as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what that tag means to be <unk> by fear not to be able to do with <unk> expectations.
Take a <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the White Music Music in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star embrace the feminism and to know about women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of it.
<unk> the time, critical critics began endless debates whether it was <unk> it was not yet yet yet.
He would be able to think about his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We are going to go far beyond optimal criticism and constructive to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the day, go to action and be a little <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to deliver a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that it makes it more difficult for women to make equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two little <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
So where they were excited about the strong creatures that they are.
I think of all of a sudden, the best option is going to be <unk> as something easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television show is about sexual violence against women like sports, and <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio firm when we heard songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their companions like <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men, heterosexual men, you can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, to participate in their project, or work with you, until they don't even have a number of women for us to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also encourage us to be even even even even as far as we are even even even even more as though that we have to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not reckless <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in human power and producers of film and music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say with bravery for us -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because the ancient voice my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few guys were <unk> when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it wasn't nothing.
I put my voice, and after everything I didn't bother to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I specialize in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me, and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have brown skin you have brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it wasn't nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and he also discovered that if I was a little brave man, another woman could <unk> and see that none of us is the world that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other one, I argue the pain reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we could all be a little brave when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California, had been <unk> by having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily pessimistic diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed <unk> about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will be in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
So the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she believed to develop his entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence continued only only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the decade of 1990, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if you could catch up another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control <unk> what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "A better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be told by what they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article which describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds, private worlds, even their own parents.
They could do fun for hours by shaking their hands in front of their faces, but they were confined to panic -- like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
And by 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, I declared that there was less than 150 stories of their syndrome, as they were <unk> the references to places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine from every 10 children sent up for other doctors to their doctor's office, not giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child <unk> and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have stayed carefully on a fridge you don't know.
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they put together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I was two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills and claiming things like the children were just going to tell them what they had heard of their parents -- they were desperate to win their approval itself.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Surprisingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a weekly cognitive psychologist, I thought that the theory of <unk> moms was pretty stupid.
She and her husband and John was warm and <unk> and they had a very deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as freedom without support, without special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, Judith <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was so much more wide and diverse and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk>
In other ways, these kids don't <unk> in beautiful frames and <unk> as he said, and saw a lot of them, so much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one hadn't noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> at their own work.
There was not even a translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he was translated for her.
The document offers a story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a college school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas for Asperger's for children to teach children of learning were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in your clinic started with a little set of exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability as disability by life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces throughout the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and they started to help the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse variety that included a staggering <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> as the <unk> social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes went into <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a wider and inclusive model.
These changes didn't fell in <unk> broken.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world saw an adult adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> performance as <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition and <unk> recognition of the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted and <unk> and they were actually hoping that the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in diagnostics. A simple simple, powerful story -- credible history, as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If today's current estimate of that one in every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right -- the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have been joined on the Internet to reject the idea that these puzzles are by solving for the new developments for the new medical developments -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work on Windows -- it doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to details.
Of course, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities from support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
